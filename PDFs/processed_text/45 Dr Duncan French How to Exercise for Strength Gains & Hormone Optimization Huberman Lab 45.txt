00:05:44 Duncan’s Background Exercise Science

So, again, interested, go headspace.com/specialoffer. now,
conversation Dr. Duncan French. Duncan French, great see again. -
Likewise, likewise, thank you. don't often many Stanford professors
Performance Institute, really excited. - Oh, well, place amazing,
huge role making is. reason excited talk
one rare beasts involved human performance
athletic performance collegiate level. obviously involved MMA
now, UFC Performance Institute. also fortunate experience, like
think, PhD in... exactly PhD in? - exercise physiology. -
Exercise physiology. So, familiar also designing studies, control groups,
sorts things opinion, anyway, kind lacking internet social
media version exercise science, people throw sorts ideas


people training, eating not eating
doing. certainly, science doesn't answers, just think rare
find somebody convergence different fields. so, lot
questions today sure audience going really interested in.
- Well, listen, mean, appreciate that. humbling, yeah, worked hard
get am, always tried authentic. think authenticity comes
alongside academic rigor, objectivity, insight knowledge base, right?
end day, confidence, expertise able deliver
expertise to, world, athletes. think, always tried
do. tried many strings bow can talk many different hats
on. know, one day talking coach, next day talking athlete,
next day talking CEO, next day talking academic professor. so,
think able wear different hats certainly skillset tried build
throughout career. like said, blessed work with, think 36
different professional Olympic sports last time counted. - Amazing. - So, yeah,
wild ride. great. - sports unusual? -
worked crown green bowling. - Wait, what? - don't know, American
guy, don't know- - never heard it. - well know that, basically
imagine 20 foot 20 foot square turf small raise middle, i.e. crown.
So, slopes edges. - Okay. - then, throw white jack, smaller ball,
roll larger balls try get closest jack. European
thing, say. - Interesting. - yeah, sports performance crown green bowling,
go. - right. [Duncan laughing] Wow, mixed martial arts, fighters-
- Absolutely, go. - everything between. So, along lines, can
give us little bit background? Where'd start out?
originally? - Yeah, northeast England. town called
Harrogate, Yorkshire, northern kind area UK- - Nice sunny
weather year long? - Yeah, can imagine. Yeah, two weeks summer
get, know? [Duncan laughs] yeah, mean, undergraduate
studies sports science. teacher training physical education teacher
that. Like people worked high school physical education teacher.
know, great experience working kids, developing athletic qualities.
something back mind always, wanted more, wanted higher
end elite sport. failed athlete like many people. represented country


different sports things, never made professionally. So, little seed
sown much started reach different areas PhD, whether
UK also, chance arm, took punt, see get states.
mean, buddies going gap years finish university whatever,
going Bali hanging whatever, traveling Thailand. figured,
well, always loved states can go kill two birds one stone
something academic, continue studies, also different environment
get life experience. many, many rejections, sure kind aware
different professors, whether Roger Noecker William Kramer- - wrote
folks? - just cold called send information saying, "Yeah,
got opportunities?" Pushed back all, dogged kept asking,
yeah, Dr. William Kramer, Ball State University Indiana time,
muscle neuroendocrinologist researcher muscle physiology using resistance
training, basically said, listen, can guarantee funding first year
studies, not next three. - Sounds like typical academic response. - Yeah. - can
take care you, not well necessarily. - Right. - Right, yeah. - Yeah, so, spoke
parents said, "Hey, can take punt?" great supporting
me. yeah, long story short, came begin PhD Ball State. year, Dr.
Kramer transferred UConn, Connecticut, Storrs, Northeast there.
transferred yeah, four great years PhD getting PhD
really prolific research group looked neuroendocrinology, hormonal work,
using resistance training primarily exercise stressor major mechanism,
looking different physiologies off back resistance training. - Yeah,
guys enormously productive. found dozens papers weight training
impacts hormones name 'em. remarkable.

00:11:45 Certain Exercises Increase Testosterone

question this. just inject question weight training
hormones. hear time big, heavy compound movements
resistance training increases androgens, things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA,
forth. anyone know actually happens? Like engaging
motor neurons heavy loads sends signal endocrine system, "Hey, release
testosterone." never actually able find textbook. - [Duncan] Yeah,


well, mean- - can that? [both laughing] - Yeah, much
know, again, digging annals Duncan French's kind brain now,
yeah. mean, think stress response, right? mechanical stress
metabolic stress. downstream regulation testosterone release
gonads comes many different areas. work primarily looked
catecholamines sympathetic arousal. - things like epinephrin, adrenaline? -
Correct, yeah, epinephrin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, signaling;
signaling cascade using HPA axis, releasing cortisol, looking
also influenced adrenal medulla release androgens signaling
gonads. - raises interesting question. So, presumably weight training
women, people don't testes also increases testosterone. - Yes, yeah. -
purely adrenals? women lift weights, adrenal glands
release testosterone? - Absolutely. mean, area testosterone release
females. yes, downstream cascade. Obviously extent
happens significantly less females, good data shows
females can increase anabolic environment, internal anabolic milieu using
resistance training stressor. get consequent muscle tissue
growth, whether tendon, ligament, adaptations, beneficial consequences
resistance training, driven anabolic stimuli. - Yeah, two questions
that. first one something mentioned, androgens,
testosterone comes adrenals resistance loads women.
true men? mean, hear testes produce testosterone weight train
men testes, know whether not adrenals testes
men increasing testosterone both- - Yeah think that- - little bit
each? - field divided presently much understanding acute adrenergic
response terms anabolic response exercise acute phase exposure
stimulus stress driven, might partly adrenal glands, partly
gonads, versus longitudinal exposure anabolic environments,
primarily driven obviously gonads endocrine environment
testosterone release gonads. So, field split terms exercise
promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth. whether much adrenal
stimuli, significant enough acute responses versus longitudinal
exposure just elevated basal levels anabolic testosterone habitual level. - So,
sounds like things, probably both. probably adrenals- - Absolutely,


yeah. - gonads. mentioned testosterone can enhancing
effects growth effects tendon ligament also. don't often hear that.
People always think, testosterone, muscle. testosterone lot effects
tissues important performance sounds like? - Yeah. - Yeah story
there? - Yeah, absolutely, think testosterone hormone is... mean, listen,
androgen receptors neural tissue neural axons. - Pretty much everywhere. Yeah. -
Exactly, so, binding capacity testosterone influence different tissues within
body, touched muscle tissue, ligaments, tendons, even bone
extent, testosterone potential influence terms removing osteopenic kind
characteristics, et cetera. So, yeah, magic hormone say, many end
impacts terms adaptation. - definitely want get back trajectory,

00:16:22 Kind Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?

long interactions androgens, testosterone
derivatives different tissues, work PhD student
throughout career, say general principles training
favor testosterone production, terms somebody not elite athlete
use? Somebody already adapted weight training somewhat, like
know difference dumbbell barbell, know various
movements, not going damage themselves. that,
mean, heard shorter sessions better longer sessions, rep loads,
weight... Now, lot parameter space. going throw
parameters think important pay attention typical
person trying use weight training build maintain muscle. - Yeah. - Lose
body fat, body recomposition and/or stay strong healthy sport different
kind. - Yeah, work obviously, exposed back PhD,
double-edged sword. much testosterone really stimulated intensity
factor also volume factor. Now, growth hormone little bit different.
largely driven intensity factor alone. - Oh, really? - Correct. - always thought
growth hormone driven volume, just goes show you. - Maybe got
wrong. - No, no, no, no. think probably right just goes show
internet- - Right, right. - completely... Not
wrong, usually backwards. So, no trust- - trust instinct. - No, trust instinct


think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

people training, eating not eating
doing. certainly, science doesn't answers, just think rare
find somebody convergence different fields. so, lot
questions today sure audience going really interested in.
- Well, listen, mean, appreciate that. humbling, yeah, worked hard
get am, always tried authentic. think authenticity comes
alongside academic rigor, objectivity, insight knowledge base, right?
end day, confidence, expertise able deliver
expertise to, world, athletes. think, always tried
do. tried many strings bow can talk many different hats
on. know, one day talking coach, next day talking athlete,
next day talking CEO, next day talking academic professor. so,
think able wear different hats certainly skillset tried build
throughout career. like said, blessed work with, think 36
different professional Olympic sports last time counted. - Amazing. - So, yeah,
wild ride. great. - sports unusual? -
worked crown green bowling. - Wait, what? - don't know, American
guy, don't know- - never heard it. - well know that, basically
imagine 20 foot 20 foot square turf small raise middle, i.e. crown.
So, slopes edges. - Okay. - then, throw white jack, smaller ball,
roll larger balls try get closest jack. European
thing, say. - Interesting. - yeah, sports performance crown green bowling,
go. - right. [Duncan laughing] Wow, mixed martial arts, fighters-
- Absolutely, go. - everything between. So, along lines, can
give us little bit background? Where'd start out?
originally? - Yeah, northeast England. town called
Harrogate, Yorkshire, northern kind area UK- - Nice sunny
weather year long? - Yeah, can imagine. Yeah, two weeks summer
get, know? [Duncan laughs] yeah, mean, undergraduate
studies sports science. teacher training physical education teacher
that. Like people worked high school physical education teacher.
know, great experience working kids, developing athletic qualities.
something back mind always, wanted more, wanted higher
end elite sport. failed athlete like many people. represented country


different sports things, never made professionally. So, little seed
sown much started reach different areas PhD, whether
UK also, chance arm, took punt, see get states.
mean, buddies going gap years finish university whatever,
going Bali hanging whatever, traveling Thailand. figured,
well, always loved states can go kill two birds one stone
something academic, continue studies, also different environment
get life experience. many, many rejections, sure kind aware
different professors, whether Roger Noecker William Kramer- - wrote
folks? - just cold called send information saying, "Yeah,
got opportunities?" Pushed back all, dogged kept asking,
yeah, Dr. William Kramer, Ball State University Indiana time,
muscle neuroendocrinologist researcher muscle physiology using resistance
training, basically said, listen, can guarantee funding first year
studies, not next three. - Sounds like typical academic response. - Yeah. - can
take care you, not well necessarily. - Right. - Right, yeah. - Yeah, so, spoke
parents said, "Hey, can take punt?" great supporting
me. yeah, long story short, came begin PhD Ball State. year, Dr.
Kramer transferred UConn, Connecticut, Storrs, Northeast there.
transferred yeah, four great years PhD getting PhD
really prolific research group looked neuroendocrinology, hormonal work,
using resistance training primarily exercise stressor major mechanism,
looking different physiologies off back resistance training. - Yeah,
guys enormously productive. found dozens papers weight training
impacts hormones name 'em. remarkable.

00:11:45 Certain Exercises Increase Testosterone

question this. just inject question weight training
hormones. hear time big, heavy compound movements
resistance training increases androgens, things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA,
forth. anyone know actually happens? Like engaging
motor neurons heavy loads sends signal endocrine system, "Hey, release
testosterone." never actually able find textbook. - [Duncan] Yeah,


well, mean- - can that? [both laughing] - Yeah, much
know, again, digging annals Duncan French's kind brain now,
yeah. mean, think stress response, right? mechanical stress
metabolic stress. downstream regulation testosterone release
gonads comes many different areas. work primarily looked
catecholamines sympathetic arousal. - things like epinephrin, adrenaline? -
Correct, yeah, epinephrin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, signaling;
signaling cascade using HPA axis, releasing cortisol, looking
also influenced adrenal medulla release androgens signaling
gonads. - raises interesting question. So, presumably weight training
women, people don't testes also increases testosterone. - Yes, yeah. -
purely adrenals? women lift weights, adrenal glands
release testosterone? - Absolutely. mean, area testosterone release
females. yes, downstream cascade. Obviously extent
happens significantly less females, good data shows
females can increase anabolic environment, internal anabolic milieu using
resistance training stressor. get consequent muscle tissue
growth, whether tendon, ligament, adaptations, beneficial consequences
resistance training, driven anabolic stimuli. - Yeah, two questions
that. first one something mentioned, androgens,
testosterone comes adrenals resistance loads women.
true men? mean, hear testes produce testosterone weight train
men testes, know whether not adrenals testes
men increasing testosterone both- - Yeah think that- - little bit
each? - field divided presently much understanding acute adrenergic
response terms anabolic response exercise acute phase exposure
stimulus stress driven, might partly adrenal glands, partly
gonads, versus longitudinal exposure anabolic environments,
primarily driven obviously gonads endocrine environment
testosterone release gonads. So, field split terms exercise
promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth. whether much adrenal
stimuli, significant enough acute responses versus longitudinal
exposure just elevated basal levels anabolic testosterone habitual level. - So,
sounds like things, probably both. probably adrenals- - Absolutely,


yeah. - gonads. mentioned testosterone can enhancing
effects growth effects tendon ligament also. don't often hear that.
People always think, testosterone, muscle. testosterone lot effects
tissues important performance sounds like? - Yeah. - Yeah story
there? - Yeah, absolutely, think testosterone hormone is... mean, listen,
androgen receptors neural tissue neural axons. - Pretty much everywhere. Yeah. -
Exactly, so, binding capacity testosterone influence different tissues within
body, touched muscle tissue, ligaments, tendons, even bone
extent, testosterone potential influence terms removing osteopenic kind
characteristics, et cetera. So, yeah, magic hormone say, many end
impacts terms adaptation. - definitely want get back trajectory,

00:16:22 Kind Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?

long interactions androgens, testosterone
derivatives different tissues, work PhD student
throughout career, say general principles training
favor testosterone production, terms somebody not elite athlete
use? Somebody already adapted weight training somewhat, like
know difference dumbbell barbell, know various
movements, not going damage themselves. that,
mean, heard shorter sessions better longer sessions, rep loads,
weight... Now, lot parameter space. going throw
parameters think important pay attention typical
person trying use weight training build maintain muscle. - Yeah. - Lose
body fat, body recomposition and/or stay strong healthy sport different
kind. - Yeah, work obviously, exposed back PhD,
double-edged sword. much testosterone really stimulated intensity
factor also volume factor. Now, growth hormone little bit different.
largely driven intensity factor alone. - Oh, really? - Correct. - always thought
growth hormone driven volume, just goes show you. - Maybe got
wrong. - No, no, no, no. think probably right just goes show
internet- - Right, right. - completely... Not
wrong, usually backwards. So, no trust- - trust instinct. - No, trust instinct


think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

different sports things, never made professionally. So, little seed
sown much started reach different areas PhD, whether
UK also, chance arm, took punt, see get states.
mean, buddies going gap years finish university whatever,
going Bali hanging whatever, traveling Thailand. figured,
well, always loved states can go kill two birds one stone
something academic, continue studies, also different environment
get life experience. many, many rejections, sure kind aware
different professors, whether Roger Noecker William Kramer- - wrote
folks? - just cold called send information saying, "Yeah,
got opportunities?" Pushed back all, dogged kept asking,
yeah, Dr. William Kramer, Ball State University Indiana time,
muscle neuroendocrinologist researcher muscle physiology using resistance
training, basically said, listen, can guarantee funding first year
studies, not next three. - Sounds like typical academic response. - Yeah. - can
take care you, not well necessarily. - Right. - Right, yeah. - Yeah, so, spoke
parents said, "Hey, can take punt?" great supporting
me. yeah, long story short, came begin PhD Ball State. year, Dr.
Kramer transferred UConn, Connecticut, Storrs, Northeast there.
transferred yeah, four great years PhD getting PhD
really prolific research group looked neuroendocrinology, hormonal work,
using resistance training primarily exercise stressor major mechanism,
looking different physiologies off back resistance training. - Yeah,
guys enormously productive. found dozens papers weight training
impacts hormones name 'em. remarkable.

00:11:45 Certain Exercises Increase Testosterone

question this. just inject question weight training
hormones. hear time big, heavy compound movements
resistance training increases androgens, things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA,
forth. anyone know actually happens? Like engaging
motor neurons heavy loads sends signal endocrine system, "Hey, release
testosterone." never actually able find textbook. - [Duncan] Yeah,


well, mean- - can that? [both laughing] - Yeah, much
know, again, digging annals Duncan French's kind brain now,
yeah. mean, think stress response, right? mechanical stress
metabolic stress. downstream regulation testosterone release
gonads comes many different areas. work primarily looked
catecholamines sympathetic arousal. - things like epinephrin, adrenaline? -
Correct, yeah, epinephrin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, signaling;
signaling cascade using HPA axis, releasing cortisol, looking
also influenced adrenal medulla release androgens signaling
gonads. - raises interesting question. So, presumably weight training
women, people don't testes also increases testosterone. - Yes, yeah. -
purely adrenals? women lift weights, adrenal glands
release testosterone? - Absolutely. mean, area testosterone release
females. yes, downstream cascade. Obviously extent
happens significantly less females, good data shows
females can increase anabolic environment, internal anabolic milieu using
resistance training stressor. get consequent muscle tissue
growth, whether tendon, ligament, adaptations, beneficial consequences
resistance training, driven anabolic stimuli. - Yeah, two questions
that. first one something mentioned, androgens,
testosterone comes adrenals resistance loads women.
true men? mean, hear testes produce testosterone weight train
men testes, know whether not adrenals testes
men increasing testosterone both- - Yeah think that- - little bit
each? - field divided presently much understanding acute adrenergic
response terms anabolic response exercise acute phase exposure
stimulus stress driven, might partly adrenal glands, partly
gonads, versus longitudinal exposure anabolic environments,
primarily driven obviously gonads endocrine environment
testosterone release gonads. So, field split terms exercise
promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth. whether much adrenal
stimuli, significant enough acute responses versus longitudinal
exposure just elevated basal levels anabolic testosterone habitual level. - So,
sounds like things, probably both. probably adrenals- - Absolutely,


yeah. - gonads. mentioned testosterone can enhancing
effects growth effects tendon ligament also. don't often hear that.
People always think, testosterone, muscle. testosterone lot effects
tissues important performance sounds like? - Yeah. - Yeah story
there? - Yeah, absolutely, think testosterone hormone is... mean, listen,
androgen receptors neural tissue neural axons. - Pretty much everywhere. Yeah. -
Exactly, so, binding capacity testosterone influence different tissues within
body, touched muscle tissue, ligaments, tendons, even bone
extent, testosterone potential influence terms removing osteopenic kind
characteristics, et cetera. So, yeah, magic hormone say, many end
impacts terms adaptation. - definitely want get back trajectory,

00:16:22 Kind Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?

long interactions androgens, testosterone
derivatives different tissues, work PhD student
throughout career, say general principles training
favor testosterone production, terms somebody not elite athlete
use? Somebody already adapted weight training somewhat, like
know difference dumbbell barbell, know various
movements, not going damage themselves. that,
mean, heard shorter sessions better longer sessions, rep loads,
weight... Now, lot parameter space. going throw
parameters think important pay attention typical
person trying use weight training build maintain muscle. - Yeah. - Lose
body fat, body recomposition and/or stay strong healthy sport different
kind. - Yeah, work obviously, exposed back PhD,
double-edged sword. much testosterone really stimulated intensity
factor also volume factor. Now, growth hormone little bit different.
largely driven intensity factor alone. - Oh, really? - Correct. - always thought
growth hormone driven volume, just goes show you. - Maybe got
wrong. - No, no, no, no. think probably right just goes show
internet- - Right, right. - completely... Not
wrong, usually backwards. So, no trust- - trust instinct. - No, trust instinct


think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

well, mean- - can that? [both laughing] - Yeah, much
know, again, digging annals Duncan French's kind brain now,
yeah. mean, think stress response, right? mechanical stress
metabolic stress. downstream regulation testosterone release
gonads comes many different areas. work primarily looked
catecholamines sympathetic arousal. - things like epinephrin, adrenaline? -
Correct, yeah, epinephrin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, signaling;
signaling cascade using HPA axis, releasing cortisol, looking
also influenced adrenal medulla release androgens signaling
gonads. - raises interesting question. So, presumably weight training
women, people don't testes also increases testosterone. - Yes, yeah. -
purely adrenals? women lift weights, adrenal glands
release testosterone? - Absolutely. mean, area testosterone release
females. yes, downstream cascade. Obviously extent
happens significantly less females, good data shows
females can increase anabolic environment, internal anabolic milieu using
resistance training stressor. get consequent muscle tissue
growth, whether tendon, ligament, adaptations, beneficial consequences
resistance training, driven anabolic stimuli. - Yeah, two questions
that. first one something mentioned, androgens,
testosterone comes adrenals resistance loads women.
true men? mean, hear testes produce testosterone weight train
men testes, know whether not adrenals testes
men increasing testosterone both- - Yeah think that- - little bit
each? - field divided presently much understanding acute adrenergic
response terms anabolic response exercise acute phase exposure
stimulus stress driven, might partly adrenal glands, partly
gonads, versus longitudinal exposure anabolic environments,
primarily driven obviously gonads endocrine environment
testosterone release gonads. So, field split terms exercise
promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth. whether much adrenal
stimuli, significant enough acute responses versus longitudinal
exposure just elevated basal levels anabolic testosterone habitual level. - So,
sounds like things, probably both. probably adrenals- - Absolutely,


yeah. - gonads. mentioned testosterone can enhancing
effects growth effects tendon ligament also. don't often hear that.
People always think, testosterone, muscle. testosterone lot effects
tissues important performance sounds like? - Yeah. - Yeah story
there? - Yeah, absolutely, think testosterone hormone is... mean, listen,
androgen receptors neural tissue neural axons. - Pretty much everywhere. Yeah. -
Exactly, so, binding capacity testosterone influence different tissues within
body, touched muscle tissue, ligaments, tendons, even bone
extent, testosterone potential influence terms removing osteopenic kind
characteristics, et cetera. So, yeah, magic hormone say, many end
impacts terms adaptation. - definitely want get back trajectory,

00:16:22 Kind Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?

long interactions androgens, testosterone
derivatives different tissues, work PhD student
throughout career, say general principles training
favor testosterone production, terms somebody not elite athlete
use? Somebody already adapted weight training somewhat, like
know difference dumbbell barbell, know various
movements, not going damage themselves. that,
mean, heard shorter sessions better longer sessions, rep loads,
weight... Now, lot parameter space. going throw
parameters think important pay attention typical
person trying use weight training build maintain muscle. - Yeah. - Lose
body fat, body recomposition and/or stay strong healthy sport different
kind. - Yeah, work obviously, exposed back PhD,
double-edged sword. much testosterone really stimulated intensity
factor also volume factor. Now, growth hormone little bit different.
largely driven intensity factor alone. - Oh, really? - Correct. - always thought
growth hormone driven volume, just goes show you. - Maybe got
wrong. - No, no, no, no. think probably right just goes show
internet- - Right, right. - completely... Not
wrong, usually backwards. So, no trust- - trust instinct. - No, trust instinct


think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

yeah. - gonads. mentioned testosterone can enhancing
effects growth effects tendon ligament also. don't often hear that.
People always think, testosterone, muscle. testosterone lot effects
tissues important performance sounds like? - Yeah. - Yeah story
there? - Yeah, absolutely, think testosterone hormone is... mean, listen,
androgen receptors neural tissue neural axons. - Pretty much everywhere. Yeah. -
Exactly, so, binding capacity testosterone influence different tissues within
body, touched muscle tissue, ligaments, tendons, even bone
extent, testosterone potential influence terms removing osteopenic kind
characteristics, et cetera. So, yeah, magic hormone say, many end
impacts terms adaptation. - definitely want get back trajectory,

00:16:22 Kind Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?

long interactions androgens, testosterone
derivatives different tissues, work PhD student
throughout career, say general principles training
favor testosterone production, terms somebody not elite athlete
use? Somebody already adapted weight training somewhat, like
know difference dumbbell barbell, know various
movements, not going damage themselves. that,
mean, heard shorter sessions better longer sessions, rep loads,
weight... Now, lot parameter space. going throw
parameters think important pay attention typical
person trying use weight training build maintain muscle. - Yeah. - Lose
body fat, body recomposition and/or stay strong healthy sport different
kind. - Yeah, work obviously, exposed back PhD,
double-edged sword. much testosterone really stimulated intensity
factor also volume factor. Now, growth hormone little bit different.
largely driven intensity factor alone. - Oh, really? - Correct. - always thought
growth hormone driven volume, just goes show you. - Maybe got
wrong. - No, no, no, no. think probably right just goes show
internet- - Right, right. - completely... Not
wrong, usually backwards. So, no trust- - trust instinct. - No, trust instinct


think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

think people just make stuff up. - Right. - hard
measure growth hormone testosterone. can't imagine stuff
see taking drips measuring free versus bound kind
stuff, laboratories. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - look total
composition look much free circulating- - Yeah. - system,
much bound, therefore biologically active bound receptor, creating
adaptation. - Right. - yeah, coming back testosterone terms training
strategies, largely driven intensity volume factor. look
many exercise interventions use try investigate interrogate
testosterone, usually six 10 protocol. So, touching about- - Six 10
meaning? - Yeah, six sets 10 repetitions, quite large... 60 repetitions
quite large volume single exercise. usually pitched 80%
intense one repetition max intensity. - Okay, 80% one rep max, six sets 10
reps, separated rest like- - Two minutes. - Two minutes, actually pretty
fast. - Yeah. - least me. Anytime see two three minutes,
actually watching clock, two minute rest periods go pretty fast. -
third, fourth set dying more, yeah. - Yeah. - think formulated kind
exercise protocol really target release testosterone try drive
anabolic environments study endocrine consequences. think type
protocol advantageous driving anabolic environment. -
workout? it? - Yeah, mean, back squat. So,
multi-joint, challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load one
repetition max. then, six 10. play around classic German
Volume Type, 10 10 kind protocols, just unsustainable 80%.
key also always adjusted loads make sure
10 repetitions sustained. load high athlete
participant drop weights sixth repetition, unload bar
make sure completed 10 repetitions. - see. - Bringing back point
intensity volume derivative going advantageous
testosterone release. - really interesting.

00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods

one thing mentioned especially interesting me, said


go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

go six sets 10 repetitions 10 sets 10 repetitions, not
beneficial might even counterproductive. me, difference six
10 sets four sets. doesn't even sound much. sort hints
possibility thresholds going workout increases testosterone
workout diminishes testosterone actually pretty narrow margin. - Yeah
think comes back intensity factor then. saw 10 10
protocol really sees pretty significant drop-offs load. again, trying
stimulate intensity, mechanical strain intensity, well metabolic
strain volume. think paradigm got look
mechanical load come actual weight bar, volume
metabolic stimulus. much driving lactate? much driving
glycogenolysis terms type energy system executing 10 10 protocol?
often saw just significant reduction intensity capabilities
athlete sustain that. shortened volume try maintain intensity. -
Interesting. imagine just taking long rest, keeping session,
big, lazy bear training. - Right. - sometimes this. tell going work
45 minutes two hours later, done, not huffing
puffing whole time, training really slowly. - Right. -
evidence training slowly can offset negative effects lot
volume? - Well, old adage of... Two responses question. mean, first
one, say difference 10 sets six six sets 10.
think comes back volume conversation. Six sets 10 driving metabolic
stimulus. 10 sets six, can probably take higher intensity,
not going get metabolic load. not going get
internal metabolic environment drives lactate release, will signal
anabolic testosterone release lactate body. key
consideration. rest often consideration overlooked general
population, many sporting environments. rest important program
variable load intensity load, volume, et cetera. yes,
extend volume, extend duration rest periods,
ultimately influencing metabolic stimulus again. allowing flushing
body, removal waste products, lactate removed body,
metabolic environment reduced. - So, understand correctly, want
create metabolic stress. - Absolutely. - So, way training, slow


lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

lazy, not necessarily best way go? could, theory, 45 60 minute
session pack work per unit time. not going able quote
unquote perform well. won't able lift much. - Yep. - might unweight
bar sets maybe even sets someone that,
sounds like way go. So, old adage high intensity, short duration
probably way go. - Correct. layman's terms, objective,
training goal just muscle tissue growth, not talking maximal
strength type parameters, just talking growing muscle.
athlete six sets 10 two minutes rest, athlete
B six sets 10 three minute rest, athlete will likely see highest
muscle gains. - Hm. - Muscle hypertrophy gains metabolic stimulus
driving shorter rest periods. - Interesting. years
spent exploring exercise science trying get information internet
various places first time ever told clearly. So, basically
need put ego aside need not focus much getting many reps
given weight keep rest restricted two minutes. - Yeah. - Get work
in, derive benefits. - mean, absolutely nailed honest.
again, think human nature approach, inherently lazy,
right? humans, want take rest. want take time recover
feel refreshed, trying create training stimulus. trying create
specific stimulus internal body, often driven metabolic
environment moment time. Now, allow metabolic environment
change extending rest periods, not going see beneficial gains
end it. - interesting. - So, much motivational ego thing rather
saying, "Okay, going push loads high can, really challenge
maximal strength,

00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals

fewer repetitions, take longer periods time." completely different approach
training. different end goal. - Interesting. mentioned lactate, seems
still bit controversial actually triggers hypertrophy. hear lactate
buildup people, common language muscle gets torn repairs,
don't know, muscle actually tear? - mean microtrauma. - Okay, microtrauma. -


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

not least, thank interest science. [light music]


Yeah, disruption within muscle tissue sure. - Interesting. talking now
non-drug assisted people- - Correct, yeah. - Whose, just say, define
terms here. whose testosterone levels within range somewhere
300 1,500 whatever, 1,200, seem athletes take high
levels exogenous androgens can work just get protein synthesis
just work. - Yeah. - seen guys gym, right? telltale signs
not hard spot just ton volume, not necessarily moving
much weight, just bringing blood tissue. loading
on, eating ton protein, presumably 'cause basically puberty part 15.
- Right. - Right, 15th round puberty puberty,
protein synthesis machine. mean, me, pretty clear puberty. Interesting.
So, then, terms of, know audience likes try protocols,
described protocol nicely. day-to-day recovery? mean, workout
described intense, short, many days week can typical person
sustain progress? - Yeah, mean, think comes back training
age training history. Obviously resilience robustness
incremental training age. So, not protocol advise anyone go
start tomorrow. - mopping off gym floor. - Right,
time, also relative, right? 80% maximum young training age still
80% versus training 10 years, still 80%. yes, mechanical load
going significant, just tonnage, right? yeah, think protocol like that,
look two times week, something pretty intensive like that,
again, comes back point make really need be, want
better term, suffering little bit type protocol, terms
challenge load, also able tolerate metabolic stress
exposed to. bit sicko feeling lactate driving up. So,
wouldn't promote athlete type modality multiple, multiple times unless
realms bodybuilding. then, really, sole purpose
trying achieve. athletes sports diverse requirements
terms outcomes trying achieve. not just targeting muscle
growth. Muscle growth conduit increased strength, increased power, increased
speed, obviously. So, yes, trying get bigger cross-sectional area muscle means
can produce force ground wherever may be,
locomotive athlete. usually, sports, men women, not just purely seeking


muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

muscle growth. look different facets muscle endurance maximal muscle
power, muscle strength. So, got creative build
workout. bodybuilder, absolutely chasing muscle growth going
types protocols, sees high intensities high volumes
workload pretty regular basis. just somebody, weekend warrior wants
keep shape look good, say, two times week really challenging
workout like that, flex types workouts within week
volume emphasis, reduce intensity might just look larger
rep ranges 12 15 20. Another workout looking reducing
volume, increasing intensity really trying drive different stimulus give
end points success.

00:29:35 Stress Can Increase Decrease Testosterone

- Mm hm, great. No, really informative. Along lines androgens intensity.
think intensity, think epinephrin, adrenaline. since background
catacholamines testosterone, last time UFC Performance
Institute, brief conversation, want make sure got details right.
short term, big increase stress hormone can lead increase
testosterone, like parachute jump. - Correct. - so, stress can promote release
testosterone? - Yeah. - news me. - Right. - always hear stress
suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing immune system, terrible
things. short term, saying can actually increase release
testosterone. So, right? - Correct, yeah, yeah. - Okay,
second question is, cognitive interpretation stressor make difference?
words, voluntarily jump plane parachute,
different effect testosterone shove plane will?
Well, presumably parachute too. - Right, mean, PhD
work looking exposure stressor, pre-arousal
body essentially prepares stressor, manages throughout
exposure stress. actually motivated parachute jumpers.
older study looking parachute jumpers combat. then,
studying cortisol, stress response, epinephrin response
parachute jumpers. So, got us thinking about, hold on, certain workouts


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

not least, thank interest science. [light music]


just, daunting, know? like, okay, squat Saturday
whatever may be. Oh gosh, going destroy me. - talk
person don't want talk know, right? - Exactly, yeah. - mean, something,
PhD dissertation exam- - Exactly speaking- - something, yeah. - Giving public
speaking whatever may be. Now, used exercise, used resistance
training protocol athletes knew going very, challenging.
going anxiety it, knew going physical
distress it. therefore, mindset going approach
already set. saw 15 minutes prior start exposure
workout, epinephrin, noradrenaline, adrenaline already starting
prepare body sympathetically go knew going very,
challenging workout. So, brings back exercise preparation, competition
certain preparation... Preparation certain competition, excuse me. Pre-workout
routines, use music, different things know can now anecdotally
gym put place, data presented showed that... first
kind show link epinephrine norepinephrine release arousal,
consequent performance. So, force output throughout workout
intimately linked. - So, takeaway there? beneficial people get
little stressed upcoming impending event? Whether not lift gym
whether not talking somebody might intimidated talk to,
exam? stress good performance harmful? - Yeah, think
great question. think can talk physical exertion,
exploring. don't want tread toes psychologists flow state
types things, clearly- - think position scientific strength
one. - Right. - think leverage. - right. - mean, lot
friends community just say buffer answer give,
little science around flow, little neuroscience related
psychological states anyway. think got lot degrees freedom here.
- right, can breathe easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank that. - Anything like,
credit Duncan, anything dislike, send mean comments me. - Yeah, think
data, certainly, greater arousal, higher performance
physical exertion perspective. think intriguing part
findings definitely individual biokinetics hormonal kind
releases. much guys highest androgenic response


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

not least, thank interest science. [light music]


terms epinephrin release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output
longer period workout didn't. So, individuals lower
stimulus sympathetic arousal, say, certainly didn't perform well throughout
workout. Now, intriguing thing becomes okay, think really
segues combat athletes, mixed martial artists.
philosophy, paradigm now terms exposure, repeat
exposure. know, challenging workout, get
psychological stimulus? still get stress response? assumption
unlikely. accommodate, become accustomed stress body will
therefore adapt. classic overload principle, right? need take
stressor different route. think look athletes
work here, fist fight end day. nothing stressful
that. think just exposure rigors training, understand bad
positions, bad situations, know can get certain situations,
certain submission holds whatever may be, think really ties
PhD work terms guys approach really challenging
sporting arena mixed martial arts. - Yeah, definitely extreme possible
terms asking stress favor hinder performance? yeah, like
said, end day, someone trying hurt much possibly can
within bounds rules. - Right. - trying same. So, find
thesis work fascinating. never UFC Performance Institute, luckily
made right choice brought here, never come
here, still fascinated hear stress bad,
stress bad, stress bad, everything read scientific literature
stress epinephrin particular coupled testosterone response
performance adaptation, provided doesn't go long. So, unless saying
something violates that. - Absolutely, agree. - mean, work.
really important beautiful work. refer often, just glad that- - Thank
you. - bolt down, think people need know this,
discomfort beneficial.

00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth

Now, another side want ask about, use cold,


particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

particular, things like ice baths, cold showers, type cold temperature
exposure. theory, stress also, epinephrin. so, one think
use cold recovery? So, colds causes stress, cold used
recovery? don't understand. maybe just want share
thoughts that. - Yeah, no, think great question, think jury still
there, certainly, knowing conversations having.
think, talk stress, classic fight, flight freeze approach.
throwing body cold tub, ice bath, whatever may certainly going
physiological stress response. Now, people using different end
goals. again, think narrative explained. using
stress specifically manage mindset, use specific stress stimulus,
six 10 80%. just trying find something
disrupt system, something very, want better term, painful,
discomfort, whatever. just finding stressor able manage
mindset. using cold, specifically physiological perspective promote
redistribution vascularity, blood flow different vascular areas muscle
feel gone workout, damaged whatever may be, think
got understand stress mechanism is. data, literature certainly
still respect cryotherapy cold baths, cold
exposures terms level muscle tissue. target,
trying promote flushing mechanism, trying promote redistribution
blood flow, got understand cold going clamp
every part vascular system. really got understand muscle
redistributed areas interest. So, think stress response real thing
respect cold exposure. think narrative around using
cold precede conversation yes, like putting hand
hot coal. stress way jumping cold bath is. - Yeah, think
people don't realize that. going get epinephrin release holding
hand close flame. - Absolutely. - going get getting ice
bath. - body doesn't know difference, right? body not know
difference. primordial kind physiological response created
millions millions years. think physiology not changing.
fixed particular way right now, doesn't understand difference
whether six 10 challenging workout here, whether putting


hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

hands hot coal, whether lion stood front whatever,
epinephrin response level brain whole signaling cascade
same. - Mm hm, cold, heard can actually prevent beneficial
effects training. can actually get way muscle growth, et cetera. - Yeah,
pretty robust data now showing definitely influence
performance variables like strength power particular, absolutely terms
muscle hypertrophy. big kind theme world athletic performance
right now, terms periodization cold exposure recovery modality. - Interesting.
- use cold? using cold recovery periods high
training load actually pursuing, might general preparatory work,
actually trying pursue muscle growth? Well, usually get
sore. usually feel fatigued, probably not
beneficial approach use ice bath scenario, dampening,
dulling mTOR pathway hypertrophic signaling pathway. Whereas
competition phase actually quality exercise quality execution skill
technical work maintained, want throw kitchen sink recovery
capabilities recovery interventions scenario muscle building
activity bank. done general preparatory
work. now focusing technical execution. So, absolutely right. - No,
interesting. So, understand correctly, want maximize muscle growth
power improvements adaptations, inflammation response, delayed
onset muscle soreness, stuff uncomfortable hear terrible
actually stimulus adaptation. so, using cold situation might short circuit
progress. I'm, don't know ever this, iron man
something, run marathon, conditions, basically coming
race, speak, power strength going have. so, there,
reducing inflammation good going allow perform work,
essentially. - Absolutely, yeah. strategic use
interventions. time preparing competition not
appropriate time... Excuse me, appropriate time want drive recovery
make sure body optimized. far away competition
date season whatever may be, really trying just tear
body little bit, allow natural healing adaptation processes take place, well,
don't want negate that. want body optimize internal recovery


muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

muscle growth going happen, so. - interesting. - time kind
consideration need make interventions, sure. - UFC
Performance Center, fighters periodizing cold exposure? just
cold will? - Well, not just UFC. again, talk personal
experiences different sports. think just education around science
understanding concepts like use cold exposure recovery, ice bath.
Everyone wants jump ice bath. think stepped back scientists
started figure look data, now intuitive about,
well, actually might not best optimal approach. think
given sport. So, yes, certainly UFC, trying educate athletes
around appropriate timing. nutrition, ice bath
intervention, lifting weights, going run
working bike. tactics things don't
things. think stress cold exposure, consideration around
well, not just MMA fighters, athlete. think best
professionals, successful professionals really well. listen, number
one, educate themselves, build structure. think elite
level, always talk UFC, elite level, not
necessarily training harder anybody else. Everybody UFC trains hard, like
everyone training super hard, best athletes, true elite levels ones
can daily basis sustain technical output
skill development, therefore skills can improve, physical development,
physical attributes can improve. ability reproduce day-to-day basis falls
recovery conversation. Now, right time use something like ice
bath isn't, part high-performance conversation, sure. - really
scientists; building structure, figuring variables. - Yeah. -
sounds like ability quality work time one key variables. -
mean, fundamental. mean, garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out.
sport, talk mixed martial arts, truly decathlon combat.
many different attributes, whether grappling, whether wrestling, whether
transition work, whether standup striking. So, different facets
training program sport significantly large compared something like wide
receiver football. no disrespect wide receivers, run routes.
going run route, passing tree, need do. guys


ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

ground. got great ground. got great
standing up. got great back fence. many
different kind facets sport. managing distribution training
components one biggest challenges mixed martial arts best guys get
right. allow body optimize training. remember,
training? training technical tactical improvement. Now,
body fatigued just can't expose tactical development
technical development, essentially disservice. going
behind curve respect guys

00:46:55 Skill Development

can reproduce day-in day-out. - topic skill development,
regardless sport, hear time certainly intuitive person
can focus best will progress fastest. kind interesting, sometimes
talk athletes seem little bit laid back training sometimes, yet
obviously know flip switch can really dial intensity.
think optimal protocols skill learning terms physical skill
learning? Like, ever parametrized like six sets 10 reps? gets
heart neuroplasticity, still, not black box, kind black box
portions illuminated, like say. thoughts skill
development? somebody wants get better sport, recommend
particularly long short training session? intensity matter just reps? - Yeah,
think, no, not volume driven exercise. quality driven exercise. listen,
expertise not motor learning motor skill acquisition. tend default Dr.
Gabriele Wulf UNLV that. one leading proponents area.
look true skill development, rehearsal accurate movement,
accurate movement mechanics. soon becomes impacted fatigue
inaccurate movement, now losing motor learning, losing accuracy
skill. People can call muscle memory whatever want, right?
essentially grooving neural axons create movement patterns
situational throughout sport, right? Whether Cruyff turn soccer jump shot
basketball, forehand line, can carve particular posture
position skill, can isolate it, can drill again.


Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

Now, soon fatigue influencing repetition, time stop. best
coaches understand that. understand quality quantity comes
skill acquisition. answer question roundabout way, say, yes,
shorter sessions high quality. think best athletes experience
ones consciously cognitively aware every moment
training session. leave training session not necessarily just physically
fatigued, mentally fatigued completely engaged learning
process. problem becomes okay, just lots 30 minutes sessions,
got lot 30 minutes sessions get volume exposure repetition
rehearsal skill again. So, bit paradox.
bit double-edged sword, three hour session versus 90 minute session,
take 90 minute session day

00:50:05 Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role Nutrition

comes skill acquisition, going driven quality
quantity. - Yeah, training skill learning incredibly mentally fatiguing. often
wondered one works hard, whether not run weights,
hard think later day. - Right. - Yeah, really seem
something it. wondered depletion adrenaline, dopamine? sometimes
think might dopamine, totally speculating. don't data
support this, hit really hard workout run early day, oftentimes
brain just doesn't want hard mental work. gives great admiration
athletes drilling mind body day, every day, breaks.
thoughts? leads mental fatigue physical performance? -
Well, again, don't want talk out, talking man here, know? - Well,
just two scientists- - Yeah, yeah. - Speculating point. now,
giving us concrete peer-reviewed study based feedback questions.
speculate, mean, think common occurrence. People think get really
good workout morning, feel better day. - Right. - true, unless
workout really intense really long. - Yeah. - just, mind just
somehow won't latch mental work quite well. - mean, just philosophically
think coming back kind stress consideration, like public speaking taking
exam. mean, amazing coach setting training particular


way, challenging, strain related it, not talking physical strain,
talking figuring things out, figuring skill. think can stressful. Like
learning process can stressful. So, touched stress. also think hit
right technique, reward center brain, dopamine shot going fly
there. many times can get becomes
dampened. think energetic piece it. fueling brain.
carbohydrate fuel exercise actually strategy around fuel
learning fuel physical training actually pretty similar. - Glucose. - Yeah,
glucose, sugar end day, right? So, fueling accordingly around
training sessions, physical, everyone thinks, okay, going
jump treadmill going bang 15 sprints max effort, going
dropping off laying floor end it. need refuel. Well,
refueling brain demanding exercise drilling session
looking technique, trying figure out, challenging mind
figure complexity it, still needs fueled refueled afterwards.
think obviously might area athletes disservice not
appropriately fueling might considered lower intensity session,
cognitive challenge significantly high. - So, skill work drill work,
taxing brain. - Correct, yeah. - thinking, oh, wasn't pushing hard
lifts sprints, can just go off rest day, mind
drifting. - Yeah, mean, speculate. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. mean, know
presumably athletes worked with, nutrition huge
aspect that. think general public can learn lot athletic nutrition
end day, general public trying attend kids, attend
work, whether not lawyers

00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets Performance

whatever, need focus. Nutrition barbed wire topic. - Oh yeah [chuckling]. -
since free just sitting other's offices,
just speculate bit, typical person, think low
carbohydrate diets... typical person exercises, runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,
maybe not things, collection those, pushes
things well, isn't necessarily highly competitive athlete.


think nutrition doesn't include lot glucose, doesn't include lot
carbohydrates, problem okay? recommend athletes?
recommend typical people? - Yeah, again, disclaimer, not dietician,
I- - okay, dieticians don't know recommend athletes either.
say spent lot time literature now, complete mess. -
Right, yeah. - like, thought didn't understand anything brain,
nutrition science stuff place. - Right. - think have, again- -
freedom. - Large degrees freedom. - Right, right, right. mean, think comes
metabolic efficiency. never advocate high... never say never,
okay? rarely advocate high performance athlete high intensity intermittent
sport, like MMA, totally ketogenic or- - not recommend that? - No,
end day, high intensity efforts usually require carbohydrate
fueling energy produced high intensities. So, try navigate
around that. Now, listen, fighters UFC elsewhere, Matt Brown
great example, promotes ketogenic approach works him. look
science nature characteristics sport, don't necessarily
promote that. - Can interrupt real quick? ketones people
ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid
powder-based ketones,

00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose
Ketosis

even though eat rice oatmeal bread things.
known benefits ketones, even one not state ketosis? - So, use
ketones primarily aware sport, event. terms brain
health athletes potentially taking trauma brain, et cetera, looking
maintain fueling energy supply brain. yes, probably little bit
remit. don't want talk not fully familiar that. -
Well, heard ketones head injury can provide buffering component. -
Correct. - not going reverse brain damage, might able offset
micro-damage. - Right, use it, just sustain energy supply


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,

ingesting carbohydrates? interesting area people always hear
ketones think, oh, ketogenic benefit taking ketones. - Right.
- number athletes recreational athletes now well, taking liquid

metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

discuss supplements; supplements sleep, supplements focus health
benefits well. supplements may not everybody, going use
supplements, want make sure supplements highest
quality. reason, partnered Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, Thorne
supplements highest quality amounts ingredients listed
label Thorne supplements precisely matches actually contained
capsules, bottles pills powders forth. extremely important. lot
analysis supplements supplement companies shown listed
bottle often not actually contained bottle. Thorne's stringency
unmatched. partnered major sports teams, Mayo Clinic.
so, lot trust Thorne supplements right reasons. like try
Thorne supplements, can see supplements take, can go Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman. There, can see supplements take. can get
20% off supplements. navigate Thorne site


portal, can get 20% off supplements Thorne makes. also like
mention not already following us Instagram @hubermanlab, might
want so. brief science tutorials offer science-based protocols
sorts things often separate protocols information covered
Huberman Lab Podcast. also Twitter hubermanlab. last certainly
not least, thank interest science. [light music]


brain might compromised brain trauma. use
ketones. come back original question. general population yes,
think place argue actually ketogenic diet times, maybe
cycling exercise, maybe not... don't mean cycling bike, mean cycling ketosis
beneficial think going lead better metabolic management
metabolic efficiency, lower intensities fueling
metabolism lipids fats. Clearly Western diet modern day diet
heavily driven processed foods carbohydrates people become predisposed
utilization fuel source lipid use, fat use, intensities low.
So, data fighters shows well. think challenge us
working clientele require high intensity bouts effort. So, fueling
appropriately important that. Now, use tactics essentially
athletes say, kind largely ketogenic diet,
will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions. So, timed exposure
carbohydrates. not- - Post-training? - Post-training, immediately pre, during,
immediately post. rest diets, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
look like ketogenic type approaches. trying tactical
exposure maximize intensity training return metabolically
efficient diet, heavily reduced carbohydrate fueled
sessions need it. - smiling again, place, UFC Performance
Center things scientifically, me, idea, pleased hear that,
idea ketogenic diet best diet carbohydrates
low protein diets best diet.

00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition Training, “Needs Based Eating”

just, ludicrous. - Right. - mentioned metabolic efficiency. think
people might familiar term, perhaps not, way understand
metabolic efficiency teach body use fats maybe long bouts
cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates bit. teaching body tap fat
stores certain periods training. also teach body utilize
carbohydrates supplying carbohydrates immediately training training.
teach body use ketones, use appropriate time,
opposed just deciding one fuel sources good others


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer

fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic

not least, thank interest science. [light music]


bad dispensable. correct? - nailed it. mean, Bob
Seebohar, formerly USA Triathlon, guy kind came concept
metabolic efficiency, yes, absolutely right. mean, low intensities
exercise just day-to-day living, shouldn't tapping carbohydrate fuel
sources extensively. higher intensity work fight flight needs stress.
athletes individual high carbohydrate diet, going start become
predisposed utilizing fuel source preferentially. Now, low intensity, can
problematic, certainly athlete, preferentially use carbohydrate
lower intensities, exercise demand goes higher intensity, already
exhausted fuel stores. can't draw upon fat oxidation fat
just slow. essentially now become fatigued already
utilized carbohydrate stores. try yes, diet manipulation
little bit exercise manipulation say, teach body train body
preferentially use specific fuel source; fat, obviously lower intensities,
carbohydrate high intensities. will look specifically crossover point
two, tell us lot terms athlete ultimately,
metabolism working. - Well, again, smiling love
grounded something real scientific, different fuel
sources. body can adapt use number one them. think
people looking one pattern eating, one pattern exercising
going best sustain them. often look back time
felt much better switching one thing next, adaptation process
also key, right? Teaching body. just riff just little bit
further, somebody, use example, since can speculate
people's current nutrition protocols are, somebody eating particular way
want try kind periodization nutrition, one say, okay,
weeks going high intensity interval training weight training,
going eat bit carbohydrate 'cause depleting glycogen. switch
phase training longer runs, maybe training less,
maybe just working desk little bit more, might switch lower
carbohydrate diet. right? going enter competition
sort, certainly not UFC- - Right. - MMA kind clear, not
isn't wonderful sport, wouldn't good profession.
going that, think stacking carbohydrates, ketones,


fats. less right? - Yeah, said eloquently. end
day, consciously understanding exposure physical exertion is,
flexing day accordingly think that- - So, need-based eating. -
Exactly, want better term, can call whatever fancy terminology
there, yes, needs-based eating, conscious cognizant
current exercise status. taking time off, don't gorge
carbohydrates. probably need cut, going lower intensity work, even
just habitual day-to-day walking around, groceries. doesn't require
massive amounts glycogen storage carbohydrate fueling. So, can potentially
go ketogenic nature, oxidizing lipids fuel. high period
high intensity training, consciously flex diet support that.
not normal, made change, elevated demand. So, fueling
requirements regenerative, not fueling exercise, regenerative
requirements body type work going really important well.
So, yes, take carbohydrates. So, think consciously interpreting nature
diet moment time. - Yeah, like that. think
listeners podcast generally experimenters. - Right. - scientists
themselves, makes happy obviously. like think paying
attention changes making affecting themselves.
seem open trying things, provided can safely, seeing works
them. certainly going try change up. also really
creature habit. think talking today, realize probably
number things truly wrong training, also don't tend vary nutrition
training quite much should. just locked protocol.

01:05:00 Duncan’s Work Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting
Championship)

covered number things related PhD thesis work, cut off early
related trajectory. finished thesis. - Yeah. - know
Notre Dame while. first spot PhD thesis? - No, no,
basically finished PhD dropped British Olympic system 14
years. - Oh my, okay. - done three full Olympic cycles different sports, largely
strength conditioning coach practitioner. always working universities


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

Huberman Lab Podcast. also Twitter hubermanlab. last certainly
not least, thank interest science. [light music]


academia alongside, terms continuing publish write research
teach well. 'Cause enjoy teaching. - explains huge volume publications. -
Yeah [chuckling]. - don't think people realize work goes getting quality
peer-reviewed publication. not, call now Instagram, anecdata?
people something once. - Right. - experience
put world a- - Yeah. - Anecdata are, don't even know
call data. So, 14 years working British Olympic team. - Yeah,
whether GB boxing, primarily Beijing cycle, also lightweight rowers
gymnastics. London Olympic games, cycle lead strength
conditioning physical performance coach British basketball. So, GB
basketball. three years English Premier League Newcastle United
soccer team, Rio Olympic cycle, Great Britain Tae
Kwon Do. So, again, another combat sport. finished there, kind moved
University Notre Dame, went managerial position working
across different technical services; medical, nutrition, strength conditioning,
sports psychology sports science, whatever may be, Director
Performance Sciences Notre Dame athletics. then, 16 months there,
UFC came knocking recruited Notre Dame. So, great
ride, got lots athletes taught lot along way, lots coaches.
Every day school day, still try keep mentality. world call
white belt mentality. PhD, got 25 years experience high performance
sport, still learn every single day people mats ring
impressive see do. - Yeah, certainly is. got introduced MMA
just years ago. think first time came one first times
heard MMA 'cause kind laboratory, nose down. really
interesting sport incorporates many different types movement
said- - Right. - not just stand boxing, not just kicking, ground game,
everything, still learning it.

01:08:00 UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Valuable Advancing
Performance

mentioned, going beginner's mind, white belt mentality,
surprising thing terms exposed MMA


particular, opposed sports? Like unique MMA fighters, besides
huge variety tactical skills learn perfect? -
Yeah, great question. say two things. going answer two questions.
One actually reiterates already said. Like degrees freedom mixed
martial arts exponential, like no sport. got 11 different weight classes.
men's classes. women's classes. kickboxers, wrestlers,
jujitsu fighters, judoka, karate fighters. stylistic backgrounds infinite.
weight classification sport. whole issue relating making weight
rebounding fight 24 30 hours. Like just variability sport,
considerations make unprecedented compared sport
worked with. lot go antithesis
expect high performance. terms don't always clearly
defined competition schedule. guys fight, don't necessarily know
next fight going be. - closest spacing fight? - mean, listen,
think record around, just month, believe. - Oh, goodness. - So,
know, quick turnaround, guys fighting three four times
year, three times year pretty normal. bigger fighters, maybe two times year.
invariably, guys don't know next date going be.
gray area of, okay, do? Like, taking time off? just going
general prep work? going try keep knife sharpened
case get- - didn't realize this. way lot like special operations. - Absolutely,
don't know call going happen. - ready times.
isn't this, like, get ready season. - Right, yeah. Like
British Olympic Association, knew British Open, Spanish Open,
French Open, European Championships, Israeli Open, American Open,
Canadian Open, Olympic games. - circuit brain. - Right, yeah. - can
tell, yeah. - just plan like know targets going be. Here,
moving target might just hanging general prep work,
might get short notice fight. give quick call six
weeks five weeks. okay, got ramp everything really quickly. So,
real challenge terms just managing different components mixed
martial arts alone. come back question, thing truly
fascinating individuals just mental resilience. again,
touched talk, ability daily basis, look


different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body

progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities learn more, share data,
understand best mechanisms interpreting body, interpreting
body's responding training, interpreting nutrition whatever may be.
really privileged position that. also, hence today,
also trying venture really cool areas science research got
applicability, can take high performance athletes apply yourself,
Joe Blow walking street, really interesting.
everything whether CBD psychedelics, different technologies
thermal monitoring Bluetooth heart rate monitoring whatever may be,
data management, et cetera, anything between. got great partners
nutrition side, psychology side, data side. think always try
just push envelope little bit more. think keep core mission
athletes, think lot do, hence podcast, amazing platform,
great job it, can learn take elite interpret
might help us, just general population. So, think north star
provide athletes best integrated service care, also want influence
just global community put UFC forefront that. - great, well,
guys certainly it, can't let cat bag just yet.
things gearing laboratory- - Yeah, excited. - work
together, hopefully able talk share year come,
excited that. And, Duncan, look, filter use talk
people, academics otherwise, people, open mouth,
doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,
scientific expertise, stuff practical realm, immense. So,
hopefully can again. - Yes, thank you. blast. appreciate
yeah, keep 'cause know lot people
love platform. So, thanks invite.

different skillsets try engage bring training.
embrace grind, embrace process just learning, physical side
sport unprecedented. mental side, funny saying here.
always say 90% mental apart 60% physical. So, just
more. guys' ability just daily basis impressive.
Like resilience, internal drive resilience really impressive see. -
Yeah, fighters met really terrific. interesting every time
meet fighter, shouldn't surprised often soft-spoken. - Right. -
[Andrew] always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah. - know? fighting
a... comes primitive portion brain, right? large portion
brain, nonetheless. - think another skill switch. again,
recoverability piece, right? Like cannot Taipei cannot like super
charged 24 hours day going just fry system, right? think
something else really trying manage whole process,
nutritional interventions, education around sleep,
training program management, psychological interventions. look
fighters say like, guys go, like red alert run
brick wall, actually again, ability turn off means can
do. can bring normal, polite,
accommodating.

01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Different States Arousal

- Maybe even better people one reasons obsessed
human performance, high-performance, people like fighters, elite military,
even bodybuilders matters experiment. - Yeah. - find outer
limits possible. one things discovered,
describing, ability toggle high alert states calm states. typical
people can't this. see something upsets internet something
news external event pressures stressed
many, many days weeks, sometimes goes pathological, right? don't say
criticism, just human beings, within species, members
species never learn either flip switch just voluntarily toggle
states. think athletes learn extremely well. sounds like MMA


fighters even better perhaps many athletes. - mean, yeah,
odd one two struggle with, think terms chronic exposure,
see coming challenges around cyclical weight cutting, metabolic
disruption, metabolic injury, not necessarily psychological drive.
understand job them. time mats, can turn
off little bit downgrade things off mats. impressive see,
again, like, layman, just looking fight game, think going
crazy chaotic, 100 miles hour every hour every day, clearly not case.
manage energy efforts pretty well. - little bit like science.
Although maybe scientists take lesson from- - Yeah, evidence-based
practice practice-based evidence, right? - Oh, like that. [Duncan chuckling]

01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna

good. couple questions, can't help myself. know talked
temperature earlier discussed cold, can't help myself, ask
heat. earlier conversation heat adaptation,
long take human body athlete typical person maybe
exploring sauna things sort learn better sweater? sounds like
something none us want do. want stay cool, calm collected.
one reasons deliberately expose oneself heat things like growth
hormone release, et cetera. can talk this, couple questions. One,
heat exposure stress way ice bath cold exposure stress?
second one is, difference important? one
one get better heat adaptation least fighters
get better dealing heat? long take? first question, just
'cause threw three questions you, [Duncan chuckling] heat stress like cold
stress? - Yeah, think is. think heat shock proteins example, driven
stressful exposure change environment. So, think graded response
terms heat acclimation strategies, yes, touched earlier
conversation. me, heat still stressor. managed incorrectly, can
detrimental responses rather beneficial responses. - barring like
hyperthermia death, like mean, obviously heat brain much, people
will seizures die, lose neurons. right way acclimate


heat? Taking account people check doctor, et cetera.
disclaimers, just say, want get better dealing heat, want
extract benefit heat. mean, many minutes day people typically
exposing heat? often periods time? - Yeah, so,
normally start 15 minutes exposure. Now, someone's really lacking
acclimation heat, can three, five minute efforts. know
mean? actually take- - hot sauna? - [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna, take time
step out- - 200 degrees something like it? - Correct, yeah. - Fahrenheit, yeah. - 200
Fahrenheit, yes. try work 30 40 minutes 45 minutes sauna
continuous. Now, understand, advantage heat acclimation
athletes? Ultimately ability sweat lose body fluids going
advantageous weight cut process. So, ability make weight.
technique guys adopt. So, don't high sweat rates,
means going sit sauna longer longer longer get
delta sweat release. acclimated are, body
thermogenically adapted, sweat glands have, pores, can
sweat therefore lose fluid quicker, spend less time
sauna. So, it, try promote... limit exposure. comes
back first question, stressor? absolutely stressor got
spend two hours four hour period, two hours sat sauna. - Yeah,
phone- - just don't sweat enough. - Doesn't work, can't. No,
just kidding. - Right. - People, divorce phone stressor
itself. - Right, mean, yes, think a... like anything, build
temperature, build volume exposure. So, start 15 minutes
just try add add across time. now, us, kind found
14 sauna exposures starts really drive adaptations looking
for. not quick fix. heat acclimation strategy happen long fight
week long fights. process begin eight 10 weeks
fight can actually get adaptation tolerance
stressor, exposure heat. - interesting, today, talking
earlier, now, didn't realize that, makes perfect sense now
hear it, heat adaptation possible, basically can train body
become better cooling itself, sweating is. - Yeah. - mean,
known before, don't see textbooks so, yeah. - mean, listen,


ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan

doesn't make much difference, speak, learn much. going take


protocols heard today, going think training
train differently better, eating, eat differently
better sake performance just general. Thank much time,

ketogenic conversation. training body
metabolic efficient, training body tolerate heat more, training
body... Like body organism, organic system, hugely adaptable,
hugely plastic. think skill understanding whens, whys
whereofs terms changing overload, changing stimulus drive specific
adaptation. philosophically go work here. talk
adaptation-led programming. Now, adaptation-led programming fits every single
category, not just lifting weights running track. fits nutrition. fits sitting
sauna. fits cold bath not. fits many different things
driven scientific insights. really want go
business. - love it, love concept adaptation-led programming that,
not just context throwing another plate bar something like that,
every aspect one's training performance. think lot
applicable

01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective
Data

recreational athlete, too. - Yeah. - say that, comes mind 12
weeks. feels like 12 weeks nice block time someone try something
terms try something new, see adapt, adapt, maybe switch
something new. realized hard throw kind pan timeframe around
something, terms someone wanted experiment heat adaptation
experiment cold adaptation change training regimen diet, look
metabolic efficiency, think 12 weeks good period time really give
something thorough go? gain understanding well poorly
something works oneself? say eight enough? three? - mean,
long piece string kind response, right? - Yeah. - mean, yes,
just talking arbitrary numbers- - Recreational experimenter. - Yeah, like three
months exposure, 12 week training strategy, 12 week intervention
adequate say 99% things change within body, physiologically adapt
training stimulus overload stimulus, going start see either
regression progression, beneficial detrimental effects within three months.
Absolutely, say so. Now, listen, say much training blocks


three weeks long. - Right, well, constraint
sometimes people suddenly to, get call fight. - Correct, yeah. like
super condensed. scenario, always conscious body
individual, ability tolerate super overload, super condensed
exposure? Now, might purposefully. might trying
overreaching strategy really trying damage flex something. don't
mean like negatively damage, like trying damage tissue really get
adaptive response versus drawn 12 week strategy, coherent,
planned out, structured nature. yeah, listeners, say
12 weeks engage process trying change adapt body expose
something sufficient see going right approach
you. think, individual interpretation, always considered.
think comes back thinking man's athlete thinking man's
trainer, like someone going exercise, consciously understand
body's moment time, know? got real yourself.
create journal, create log training, create log feelings,
subjective feedback felt, mood, sleep. - athletes that? -
Yeah, yeah. try promote again, part process, know?
might 12 weeks you, might get responses eight weeks.
think another critical theme put 15 guys mat give
workout, going 15 different responses
workout human organism complex. nature, going adapt
differently. people will tolerate it. people going challenged it.
people got metabolic makeup going promote it. people
metabolically challenged it. just many different things
consider. try here. cross bear try
understand individual level optimize athletic performance. - think
terrific, athletes fortunate this. people there,
certainly trying encourage people learn science
mechanism become scientists pursuits, whether not skill learning

01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects UFC UFC Performance Institute

athletic pursuit, et cetera. sort final question, things


UFC something UFC perhaps people don't know terms overall
mission guys trying here? mean, think, become fan
MMA time moves on. people might MMA,
people not watching MMA, things UFC
interested people might not know about, certainly might not
know about? - Yeah, mean, think, try cutting edge. try super
progressive. think got amazing platform here, particularly
Performance Institute really cool things can inform many different
people. doesn't just mean 600 athletes global roster.
trying is, influence global community around optimizing human
performance. So, moment time, engaging different technologies
