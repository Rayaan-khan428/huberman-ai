00:04:23 Tool: Moderate Exercise & Cognitive Work

call deliberate cold exposure. talk deliberate cold exposure
many powerful applications, like highlight study find particularly
interesting, think will find particularly interesting useful. title
study brief aerobic exercise immediately enhances visual attentional control
perceptual speed, testing mediated role feelings energy. Now, reason like
study first all, fairly large size sample group. looked 101 students.
college-aged students two groups. One group 15 minutes
jogging moderate intensity. measure percent heart rates, et cetera,
analogous zone two cardio, discussed podcast before.
Zone two cardio cardiovascular exercise places level can hold
conversation little bit strain, meaning can get words out,
every catch breath whereas push


harder mechanism going faster steeper incline, et cetera,
hard time carrying conversation. zone two cardio common form
describing level intensity call moderate intensity. one group 15
minute jogging moderate intensity, translating roughly zone two cardio.
group 15 minutes relaxation concentration somewhat akin
mindfulness meditation. analyzed perceptual speed, visual
attentional control, something called working memory, ability keep
certain batches information online. Just imagine someone telling phone
number, remember sequence numbers head
period time, working memory. depends heavily so-called
prefrontal cortical networks, involved planning action. also
looked people's feelings energy measured subjectively, energetic
people felt. Now major takeaways study like emphasize
15 minutes jogging group experienced elevated levels energy period
time ceased exercise whereas group mindfulness meditation
actually reported feeling calm less overall energy. Now
subjective indeed used subjective measures analyze energy, gets
interesting looked performance various cognitive tasks
two tasks use called trail making tests, different versions
this, version A, version B, don't want go much detail, version
essentially involves page numbers distributed somewhat randomly.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight on, distributed randomly
across page people use visual search circle numbers
sequence. involves visual attention, involves motor skills, involves
number things certainly require energy focus. second test trail
making test part B, mentioned earlier, involved also circling numbers
sequence, interspersed numbers letters. rather just
circle off numbers sequence, actually connect one,
letter A, two, letter B, et cetera remember randomly
distributed across page. major takeaway study group
15 minutes moderate exercise prior two tests showed significant
decreases amount time required complete tests accurately.
interesting indeed surprising least me, many studies
looking effects mindfulness meditation ability focus. key variable


study turned energy. subjectively measured feeling say
energy thereby ability focus, especially high cognitive
demand tasks. Now takeaway study us think pretty
straightforward. going sit work requires focus
working memory cognitive attention especially visual spatial control,
meaning search things page, organize things
page, writing, arithmetic, basically cognitive work kind, 15 minutes
moderate exercise done prior work beneficial you.
not mean mindfulness meditation not benefit you. wouldn't want

years, always kept track literature area indeed
tremendous discoveries, animal models, rodents like mice rats,
also humans today going talk categories studies
careful point discoveries made animal models
made humans. key point thinking use cold tool,
key point baseline level temperature varying, changing
across 24 hour cycle. use deliberate cold exposure going super
imposed rhythm, circadian rhythm, meaning 24 hour rhythm. basic
contour circadian rhythm temperature approximately two hours
time wake so-called temperature minimum. temperature
minimum time within 24 hour cycle body temperature lowest.
normally wake around 6:00 AM, temperature minimum probably
4:00 AM. normally wake 7:00 AM, temperature minimum
probably 5:00 AM. not exactly two hours wake time,
approximately two hours wake time. Now, go
temperature minimum time going awake, temperature
rising slightly. point wake up, temperature starts go
sharply will continue go early sometimes even late
afternoon. sometime late afternoon evening, temperature will
start decline. indeed, approach sleep, body temperature will drop
anywhere one three degrees. fact decrease core body temperature
important not essential getting staying deep sleep. temperature

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion

get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one

toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine

can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience

no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done

instance, speed movement, can start combining movement

play with. goal build resilience, either go time function

resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold

training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play
phone sets. another deliberate cooling palms
bottom feet upper portion face. might get weird looks,
course one significantly volume, not experiencing delayed
onset muscle soreness achieving

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
deliberate cold exposure prepared fairly alert next one

topic takes back undergraduate years worked laboratory
studying cold physiology, effects brain effects body.
years, always kept track literature area indeed
tremendous discoveries, animal models, rodents like mice rats,
also humans today going talk categories studies
careful point discoveries made animal models
made humans. key point thinking use cold tool,
key point baseline level temperature varying, changing
across 24 hour cycle. use deliberate cold exposure going super
imposed rhythm, circadian rhythm, meaning 24 hour rhythm. basic
contour circadian rhythm temperature approximately two hours
time wake so-called temperature minimum. temperature
minimum time within 24 hour cycle body temperature lowest.
normally wake around 6:00 AM, temperature minimum probably
4:00 AM. normally wake 7:00 AM, temperature minimum
probably 5:00 AM. not exactly two hours wake time,
approximately two hours wake time. Now, go
temperature minimum time going awake, temperature
rising slightly. point wake up, temperature starts go
sharply will continue go early sometimes even late
afternoon. sometime late afternoon evening, temperature will
start decline. indeed, approach sleep, body temperature will drop
anywhere one three degrees. fact decrease core body temperature
important not essential getting staying deep sleep. temperature
rises waking, easy remember. tends continue rise throughout
day late afternoon evening, temperature WILL start go
drop temperature actually helps access sleep. background


call baseline circadian rhythm core body temperature important remember
helps us frame effects deliberate cold exposure helps us
frame might want use deliberate cold exposure order access specific
states.

00:18:41 Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin

also points times within 24 hour cycle might want avoid using
deliberate cold exposure, primary goal get sleep. circadian
rhythm temperature. Now just briefly want touch thermal regulation level

called Gedanken experiment, thought experiment. say send
desert heat jog run hot outside, 102 103 degrees,
start move, start sweat course core body temperature goes up.
Now, offer cold towel, maybe really, really cold towel towel
saturated water actually squeeze water cool
body off. Gedanken experiment say okay, going
place towel? going cool off? guessing
think best way cool off drape towel
head, maybe neck, torso, feel really, really good,
cool off. Well, exactly wrong approach want cool off.
fact, use approach, body temperature continue increase
even more. Yes, even not placed cold towel head
torso. why. Thermal regulation meaning brain body's ability
regulate internal core temperature somewhat like thermostat
thermostat resides brain. think thermostat home

body up. means want cool down, last thing want
bring cold surface kind, towel splashing water, majority
body surface. might very, surprising you. might say, wait, want
cool down, jump cold lake something sort. different
thing altogether. tell you, get depth later,
really want cool quickly efficiently, leverage particular portals,
meaning particular sites body heat can leave body readily
cooling can dramatic fast impact core body temperature, can
even save life going hyperthermic. going talk
specific protocols reduce core body temperature sake performance avoiding
hyperthermia later episode. Hyperthermia course very, dangerous
situation body can drop core temperature somewhat still
safe, can't really increase body temperature much brain starts
cook organs start cook cook, mean cells actually start die.
very, careful use heat. Heat stroke no joke. People
die heat stroke time. really want avoid that. One way avoid
cool appropriate surfaces body appropriate surfaces case
upper cheeks say upper half face, palms hands
bottoms feet. talked podcast
guest episode Dr. Craig Heller, colleague biology department Stanford,
just briefly, surfaces, upper half face, palms hands
bottoms feet call glabrous skin surfaces, G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S,
glabrous. surfaces unique just them, vasculature
different elsewhere body. Normally passage blood goes arteries
capillaries veins, just beneath glabrous skin bottoms feet,
hands upper half face, called arterio-venous
anastomoses. portals blood go directly arteries veins


so, allow body dump heat readily, quickly. turns
cool palms hands, bottoms feet upper half
face, can efficiently reduce core body temperature sake offsetting
hyperthermia improving athletic performance maybe even cognitive
performance. will return specific protocols later
episode, give lot details that, without use
fancy expensive technology. technologies now
commercially available, instance, so-called CoolMitt will allow
maximum efficiency, also give home methods either
gym runs sake cognitive work. two key themes
understand baseline circadian rhythm temperature, understand best
way cool body going making sure something cold contacts
bottoms feet, palms hands upper half face. Ideally
three goal lower core body temperature quickly, again, just cooling off
back neck top head torso towel

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion

epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes

no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects

next question always get mental state exposing

probably options well. One try calm remain

again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30

often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number

others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot

reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use

lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,

time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold

intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose

reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms
performance, talk moment, need use cool object
surface not cold causes vasoconstriction. can little bit
tough dial in, meaning can tough identify object. reason,


Dr. Heller colleagues developed commercial product called
CoolMitt. can actually go website, coolmitt.com. don't financial
relationship them. know developing technology
period time. involves glove put hand into, circulates water
given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance
volume strength training people can conduct appropriately cool
body glabrous skin portals actually quite significant. again,
relates hyperthermia, someone overheating means, try get
heat, get stop exercising, can die hyperthermia, try cool

60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.

studying cold physiology, effects brain effects body.
years, always kept track literature area indeed
tremendous discoveries, animal models, rodents like mice rats,
also humans today going talk categories studies
careful point discoveries made animal models
made humans. key point thinking use cold tool,
key point baseline level temperature varying, changing
across 24 hour cycle. use deliberate cold exposure going super
imposed rhythm, circadian rhythm, meaning 24 hour rhythm. basic
contour circadian rhythm temperature approximately two hours
time wake so-called temperature minimum. temperature
minimum time within 24 hour cycle body temperature lowest.
normally wake around 6:00 AM, temperature minimum probably
4:00 AM. normally wake 7:00 AM, temperature minimum
probably 5:00 AM. not exactly two hours wake time,
approximately two hours wake time. Now, go
temperature minimum time going awake, temperature
rising slightly. point wake up, temperature starts go
sharply will continue go early sometimes even late
afternoon. sometime late afternoon evening, temperature will
start decline. indeed, approach sleep, body temperature will drop
anywhere one three degrees. fact decrease core body temperature
important not essential getting staying deep sleep. temperature

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.

data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?

going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't

showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep

essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category

using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress

yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain

encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine

toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience

no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.

gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around

thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended

everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information

teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels

again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional

experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water

Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction

catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water

discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath

answer able arrive basis review article talk

neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours

cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers

again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount

immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,

can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form

Now commercial technology. know people started

second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens

yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine

toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done

going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot

two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor

sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,

not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck

hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold

increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,

pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures

soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like

workout extended yet much work, even though takes

clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points

experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

topic takes back undergraduate years worked laboratory
studying cold physiology, effects brain effects body.
years, always kept track literature area indeed
tremendous discoveries, animal models, rodents like mice rats,
also humans today going talk categories studies
careful point discoveries made animal models
made humans. key point thinking use cold tool,
key point baseline level temperature varying, changing
across 24 hour cycle. use deliberate cold exposure going super
imposed rhythm, circadian rhythm, meaning 24 hour rhythm. basic
contour circadian rhythm temperature approximately two hours
time wake so-called temperature minimum. temperature
minimum time within 24 hour cycle body temperature lowest.
normally wake around 6:00 AM, temperature minimum probably
4:00 AM. normally wake 7:00 AM, temperature minimum
probably 5:00 AM. not exactly two hours wake time,
approximately two hours wake time. Now, go
temperature minimum time going awake, temperature
rising slightly. point wake up, temperature starts go
sharply will continue go early sometimes even late
afternoon. sometime late afternoon evening, temperature will
start decline. indeed, approach sleep, body temperature will drop
anywhere one three degrees. fact decrease core body temperature
important not essential getting staying deep sleep. temperature
rises waking, easy remember. tends continue rise throughout
day late afternoon evening, temperature WILL start go
drop temperature actually helps access sleep. background


call baseline circadian rhythm core body temperature important remember

cool appropriate surfaces body appropriate surfaces case
upper cheeks say upper half face, palms hands

guest episode Dr. Craig Heller, colleague biology department Stanford,
just briefly, surfaces, upper half face, palms hands
bottoms feet call glabrous skin surfaces, G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S,
glabrous. surfaces unique just them, vasculature
different elsewhere body. Normally passage blood goes arteries
capillaries veins, just beneath glabrous skin bottoms feet,

so, allow body dump heat readily, quickly. turns
cool palms hands, bottoms feet upper half

performance. will return specific protocols later
episode, give lot details that, without use

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold

yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits

instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function

resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold

don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing

really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects

actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.

dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine

inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular

really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone

say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases

last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase

sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted

topic takes back undergraduate years worked laboratory
studying cold physiology, effects brain effects body.
years, always kept track literature area indeed
tremendous discoveries, animal models, rodents like mice rats,
also humans today going talk categories studies
careful point discoveries made animal models
made humans. key point thinking use cold tool,
key point baseline level temperature varying, changing
across 24 hour cycle. use deliberate cold exposure going super
imposed rhythm, circadian rhythm, meaning 24 hour rhythm. basic
contour circadian rhythm temperature approximately two hours
time wake so-called temperature minimum. temperature
minimum time within 24 hour cycle body temperature lowest.
normally wake around 6:00 AM, temperature minimum probably
4:00 AM. normally wake 7:00 AM, temperature minimum
probably 5:00 AM. not exactly two hours wake time,
approximately two hours wake time. Now, go
temperature minimum time going awake, temperature
rising slightly. point wake up, temperature starts go
sharply will continue go early sometimes even late
afternoon. sometime late afternoon evening, temperature will
start decline. indeed, approach sleep, body temperature will drop
anywhere one three degrees. fact decrease core body temperature
important not essential getting staying deep sleep. temperature
rises waking, easy remember. tends continue rise throughout
day late afternoon evening, temperature WILL start go
drop temperature actually helps access sleep. background


call baseline circadian rhythm core body temperature important remember

guest episode Dr. Craig Heller, colleague biology department Stanford,
just briefly, surfaces, upper half face, palms hands

glabrous. surfaces unique just them, vasculature
different elsewhere body. Normally passage blood goes arteries
capillaries veins, just beneath glabrous skin bottoms feet,

so, allow body dump heat readily, quickly. turns
cool palms hands, bottoms feet upper half

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness
time, going want vary parameter space sort way.
don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results

will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely

particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits

instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one

press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
deliberate cold exposure prepared fairly alert next one

cool appropriate surfaces body appropriate surfaces case
upper cheeks say upper half face, palms hands

guest episode Dr. Craig Heller, colleague biology department Stanford,
just briefly, surfaces, upper half face, palms hands
bottoms feet call glabrous skin surfaces, G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S,
glabrous. surfaces unique just them, vasculature
different elsewhere body. Normally passage blood goes arteries
capillaries veins, just beneath glabrous skin bottoms feet,

so, allow body dump heat readily, quickly. turns

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness
time, going want vary parameter space sort way.
don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex
learning behavioral control context body elevated levels
catecholamines, norepinephrine epinephrine. translates real life
much realistic way believe real life, not really engaging
stressors given amount time know long going last
know context, no. stressors arrive form surprises don't like, text

online interactions send system state increased norepinephrine
epinephrine. start think walls can tolerate climb
staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results

will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely

particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

00:25:26 Mental Effects Cold Exposure

going least efficient way lower core body temperature might even
increase body temperature certain conditions. two points mind,
can start think directed deliberate cold exposure protocols,
number different reasons use deliberate cold exposure. want separate
you. cold protocols tested peer reviewed
studies designed improve mental performance. designed improve
things like resilience grittiness, ability move challenge
regulate mind internal state conditions stress can define
stress specifically times adrenaline also called epinephrine
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, elevated body. Forgive
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, didn't make
up. turns every while, scientists disagree, imagine that, get
multiple scientists naming molecule different things. epinephrine
adrenaline thing. will use interchangeably. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline thing. will use terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline
adrenaline often co-released brain body. work kind


pair increase level agitation, level focus desire ability
move. often co-released different sites brain body
dopamine, molecule commonly misunderstood molecule pleasure,
actually molecule motivation, reward pursuit. dopamine, norepinephrine
noradrenaline tend released together certain conditions today
learn deliberate cold exposure can used cause increases release
several, not, ways can improve levels attention
mood. key point mental state shifted exposed
certain forms cold, many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically shift
body state way train mental state can better cope
stress real life real life, mean life presents stressful events, will
give specific protocols can that, words, can
become resilient use deliberate cold exposure. Now,
ways deliberate cold exposure can increase category chemicals called
catecholamines, includes dopamine, norepinephrine epinephrine, can also
used elevate mood long periods time. going discuss specific
protocol shown increase chemicals anywhere 2.5X 250%,
high 500%, five times baseline. Now might asking whether not
good thing raise chemicals like norepinephrine dopamine great
degree, whether not healthy us, whether not can harm us. turns
elevations norepinephrine dopamine long lasting ways
people report feeling vast improvements mood vast improvements levels
cognitive attention energy. read literature, seem healthy
increases baseline levels chemicals ways can really support us

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness
time, going want vary parameter space sort way.
don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex
learning behavioral control context body elevated levels
catecholamines, norepinephrine epinephrine. translates real life
much realistic way believe real life, not really engaging
stressors given amount time know long going last
know context, no. stressors arrive form surprises don't like, text

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees
Celsius, 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees
Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius, 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. not super cold,
measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one

press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed

say no reason apply ice packs way just

measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate

first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold

think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
deliberate cold exposure prepared fairly alert next one

00:29:02 Physical Effects Cold Exposure

give protocol that. Now, mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, deliberate cold exposure also studied animal
models humans context increasing metabolism, even converting
certain fat cells call white fat cells, ones energy stored,
ones typically think kind blubbery fat, beige brown fat,
thermogenic fat, meaning can increase core body temperature
serves kind furnace increase core metabolism.


broad stroke, can say white fat generally kind fat people want less
beige fat brown fat generally kind fat going fat
cells certainly need fat cells want of. thermogenic,
help stay lean. actually serve reservoir heating body
ever confronted cold challenge. going talk use cold
metabolism well. course, people using deliberate cold exposure reduce
inflammation post exercise, reduce inflammation generally. people also using
cold enhance performance

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers
good, better worse cold water immersion neck, instance. also get
lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness
time, going want vary parameter space sort way.
don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex
learning behavioral control context body elevated levels
catecholamines, norepinephrine epinephrine. translates real life
much realistic way believe real life, not really engaging
stressors given amount time know long going last
know context, no. stressors arrive form surprises don't like, text

online interactions send system state increased norepinephrine
epinephrine. start think walls can tolerate climb
staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head

measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects

variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold

long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting

actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89

dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine

stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe

afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine

Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy

not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck

hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold

increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,

pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures

soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like

workout extended yet much work, even though takes

clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points

experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

00:30:11 Cold Temperature Be?

context strength training, context endurance training talk
data well, like start mental performance
like detail happens deliberately expose cold. key
point word deliberate. don't say otherwise, throughout episode,
say cold exposure, mean deliberate cold exposure. reason point
colleague, David Spiegel, department psychiatry Stanford says,
not just state in, state whether
not anything placing state whether not
purpose not. really means statement
important effects call mindset. Mindset topic discussed guest
episode Ali Crumb weeks ago. haven't seen episode, highly
recommend it. science mindset tells us something
deliberately believe going good us, actually can lead
different set physiological effects something happening us will
without control. Now, different placebo effects. Placebo effects
distinct mindset effects. want learn distinction, please see
episode Ali Crumb. again, talk cold exposure episode,
talking deliberate cold exposure, meaning placing
cold environment purpose order extract particular set benefits. talk
deliberate cold exposure, almost always, means getting uncomfortable.
one common questions get discussing use cold sake
mental physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, cold be?
cold water be? cold environment be? just will tell


now going say throughout episode, cause will
continue true throughout episode long episode over, cold
depends cold tolerance, core metabolism, number features
simply no way know access to. like use
rule thumb. using deliberate cold exposure, environment
place place mind state whoa, really like get
environment, can stay safely. Now might seem little bit arbitrary,
say get warm shower feel really, really nice
start turning warm turning cold.
threshold feel uncomfortable you. continue
make little bit colder that, really want get shower,
confident stay without risking health, without risking heart
attack. Now different jumping very, cold lake seen
images people will cut holes frozen lakes get
cold water. trained right conditions, et cetera,
can done reasonably safely, certainly not start with.
many people, cold indeed people can go cold shock
can die consequence getting extremely cold water quickly. Now
not scare away deliberate cold exposure. just say no
simple prescriptive cold make environment order extract maximum benefit
mental physical performance. simple rule thumb going place
environment uncomfortably cold, can stay safely.
experiment bit number, meaning temperature, will vary
day day. will vary across 24 hour cycle endogenous,
meaning internal rhythm, temperature talked earlier. Low early
day, rises afternoon, drops night. can actually experiment
like. Try getting cold shower 11 o'clock night want versus try
middle afternoon. quite different experience quite different
experience, mean requires quite different degree resilience leaning
practice. willpower will higher suspect late day compared
early day, will vary course individuals well.
common question get deliberate cold exposure cold water be?
answered uncomfortably cold point



00:34:53 Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion

want get out, can safely stay in. second common
question get deliberate cold exposure whether not cold showers

lot questions whether not cryo chambers better others, et
cetera, et cetera. going make simple saying cold water
immersion neck feet hands submerged also going
effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep
hands feet easy control. means everyone can
essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category
cold exposure there. People wearing ice vests. Believe not, exist,
ice underwear. Yes, exist. can look Amazon like.
putting cold packs armpits groin elsewhere order stimulate
effects cold mental physical performance. not going address
much detail today. can efficient certain ways, learn
later episode, cooling palms, upper face bottoms feet
going far efficient unfortunately think people
using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold
exposure. deliberate cold exposure opportunity deliberately stress body
yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits

instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold

don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times

staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees
Celsius, 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees
Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius, 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. not super cold,
measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention

people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say
one minute three minutes six minutes 55 degrees 50 degrees, whether
not leads similar, greater reduced levels dopamine brain body.
yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,
stressful. didn't enjoy it, eventually grew like it, always feel better
afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine

commonly reported, enhancement mental acuity ability focus.
Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part

earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes discomfort experience
norepinephrine release, least short term, say, well, shouldn't
deliberate cold exposure also make feel uncomfortable like really want

meaning first week second week third week, one finds

whereas might previously person always cold room

literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical

discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy

main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck

move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount

particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet

one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

Now commercial technology. know people started

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.

going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep

people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't

anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry

one way approach way particularly favor take context

resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release

want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold

straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log

colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience

don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower

nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing

probably options well. One try calm remain

maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems

again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30

often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going

others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot

lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,

neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint
interval training weight workout main focus performance

nice review recently published deliberate cold exposure can impact
physical performance, whether not done after, different types training
forth. paper entitled impact cold water immersion compared

physically active participants, systematic review meta-analysis meta
regression. meta-analysis 52 studies looked tremendous number
variables contexts, expect meta-analysis 52 studies.
going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high
intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose
response relationships things like endurance training, meaning longer cold
exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever

cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes

way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body

surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused

effective. Second best cold shower. Third best go outside
minimum amount clothing, course, clothing culturally appropriate
allow experience cold point almost want
shiver start shivering. Now number different, important constraints
going dictate whether not use one form cold exposure other.
instance, people don't access cold water immersion. don't
access ice baths cold water tanks, cold ocean cold lakes, et cetera. case,
showers next best solution. want emphasize
few, any, studies cold showers, can imagine
case. laboratory, want control many variables possible. placing
people cold water immersion ice bath neck insisting keep

essentially thing whereas cold showers, people different sized bodies.
people going put head under. people going lean forward.
Measuring amount cold water exposure body hard
aren't lot studies cold showers, course, lot people don't
access cold water immersion use cold showers. don't
access both, course, going outside cold day can benefit. will
point heat transfer body water much higher, four times
greater, not even greater, depending temperature water, water
opposed air. going much efficient cold water immersion
anything else, cold showers put cold environment
third best thing. not going get cryo chambers carry
quite high degree cost. again, aren't many studies them.
access cryo chambers, sure cryo chamber facility told
incredible benefits don't doubt benefits truly exist,


people just don't resources access going leave
cryo chambers today's discussion. course realize fourth category

using ice packs increase core metabolism not aware glabrous skin
cooling can very, potent stimulus return later.

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline

get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one

toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience

days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing

here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.

vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended

everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold

80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.

again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results

will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

00:38:27 Protocols Cold Exposure

Unless say otherwise, mainly going focusing cold water immersion
cold showers. talk protocols enhancing mental health performance
using deliberate cold exposure. happens get cold
experience increase norepinephrine, noradrenaline release adrenaline
release. fact cold exposure, deliberate no, increases norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body means reliable stimulus increasing
norepinephrine epinephrine. sort obvious statement, obvious
statement can leveraged systematically build call resilience. Now,
experience stressor life, whether not something bad happens
relationship something bad happens world feel stress, stress
consequence increases norepinephrine epinephrine brain body.
similar, not identical, kinds increases come deliberate cold

yet, deliberate can take certain steps,
describe moment, can learn maintain mental clarity, can learn maintain
calm body state stress. can immensely useful
encountering stressors parts life. call resilience grit,
ability mental toughness, ability lean challenge tolerate challenge
keeping heads straight, speak. one simple protocol increasing
resilience pick temperature uncomfortable shower cold immersion,


get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness

don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex

staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal

really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects

observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold

actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.

dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases

deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine

increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting

Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results

will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely

can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs

study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset

particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number

not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold

get certain duration time get out. Now, important
understand people will experience different levels norepinephrine adrenaline
release getting cold water. people, dread cold
much, will actually experience norepinephrine epinephrine increases even
get cold water cold shower. Now may experienced
this. certainly experienced this. dreading it, don't want
force it. indeed epinephrine norepinephrine surges can
thought sort walls confront go over. like
conceptualize way, allows us build protocols can
objective can allow us monitor progress terms building resilience. one
option simply say, okay, going force get cold shower one
minute. cold, again, uncomfortably cold, can stay safely going
get ice bath one minute. Ice baths cold inevitably. also
inevitable get cold, will experience surge epinephrine
norepinephrine. non-negotiable mediated cold receptors
surface body skin way trigger release
norepinephrine epinephrine, not just adrenals, adrenal glands
kidneys, also regions brain, like locus coeruleus,
cause increases tension alertness, locations body
epinephrine norepinephrine released. words, cold non-
negotiable stimulus increasing epinephrine norepinephrine. Even
toughest person world love cold, increase epinephrine
norepinephrine going happen. way think norepinephrine
epinephrine context building mental resilience two options.
can either try extend duration time deliberate cold exposure.
going one minute 75 seconds two minutes period days
one way approach way particularly favor take context
day moment account, meaning different levels grit
resilience different days depending landscape life time, even
time day protocols start able sense release
epinephrine, norepinephrine brain body see walls
want climb order build resilience start counting number walls
traverse distance walls deliberate cold
exposure. Let give example timed protocol one


straightforward, although not think powerful building mental resilience.
time protocol Monday, one minute deliberate cold exposure
given temperature. Wednesday, extend 50% Friday, deliberate cold
exposure twice long Monday. continue every
week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, continue either increase duration
lower temperature reduce duration, kind thing, much like
sets reps gym. Now option objective. even log
book develop ability stay cold temperatures, even progressively
colder colder temperatures longer longer periods time, will become
resilient. mean that? Well, operational definition resilience
able resist escape stressor, cold, virtue willpower,
really prefrontal cortex causing top control reflexes
limbic system hypothalamus, basically telling get
cold water, get cold environment so, basically getting
better controlling behavior brain body flooded
norepinephrine epinephrine. reductionist way explain resilience
grit mental toughness, reductionist way explaining closely
tied biology end psychology. fact norepinephrine
epinephrine release brain body generic universal code stressor.
no unique chemical signature different forms stressors,
one, although course chemicals involved well. go
time try reduce temperature increase time period
days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done
10 reps. not whole lot variable space get benefits
stimulus. weight room, people understand can adjust,
instance, speed movement, can start combining movement
pre-exhaustion, et cetera. cold exposure, don't much variable space
play with. goal build resilience, either go time function
temperature, suggest start recognizing walls experience
resistance going walls, set certain number walls
going go given day given temperature, mix
up. ideally might even throw one wall end, really feeling
bold brave going build resilience. want cold
exposure work sake building resilience mental toughness
time, going want vary parameter space sort way.
don't super systematic it. beauty kind approach
relying fact walls really represent times
forcing top control, prefrontal cortex clamp reflex
learning behavioral control context body elevated levels
catecholamines, norepinephrine epinephrine. translates real life
much realistic way believe real life, not really engaging
stressors given amount time know long going last
know context, no. stressors arrive form surprises don't like, text

online interactions send system state increased norepinephrine
epinephrine. start think walls can tolerate climb
staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice
bath

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees
Celsius, 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees
Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius, 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. not super cold,
measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention
feelings wellbeing mood people typically experience deliberate
cold exposure. reason say go back episode
dopamine, go back episode Dr. Anna
Lembke addiction dopamine, find increases dopamine
sort evoked deliberate cold exposure actually similar kinds
increases dopamine elicited things like nicotine behaviors
known addictive bad us lead effects
brain body simply don't want. yet deliberate cold exposure provided
done safely can create similar not greater increases dopamine not just
fleeting, don't just occur during, say consumption deleterious drug
activity, long lasting can leveraged toward activities
deliberate cold exposure. want emphasize this. not suggesting
people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say
one minute three minutes six minutes 55 degrees 50 degrees, whether
not leads similar, greater reduced levels dopamine brain body.
yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,
stressful. didn't enjoy it, eventually grew like it, always feel better
afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine
concert increases norepinephrine also explain effect
commonly reported, enhancement mental acuity ability focus.
Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part
episode, talking use short 15 minute exercise, kind moderate
intensity exercise shown increase levels energy mental
acuity working memory, visual attention tasks. there, again,
assume somewhat weren't neurochemical measurements,
can reasonably assume improvements cognitive performance due
least part increase catecholamines known company, moderate intensity

system will sharpen mental acuity elevate mood will

catecholamines, category chemicals thereby improve mood, mental
acuity levels alertness. next see, not effect, can
beneficial many people bunch different circumstances, also
positive effects many people seek terms metabolism, lowering

one half traditional Swedish also Danish saying. half
traditional Danish-Swedish saying preparation winter, order not feel

anecdotal cultural lore, actually physiological basis, exposing

extreme cold environments, one can feel comfortable extreme cold
environments. exactly observed study Søberg et al.
men felt comfortable extreme cold trained deliberate cold
exposure, might not seem surprising all, based talked
earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes discomfort experience
norepinephrine release, least short term, say, well, shouldn't
deliberate cold exposure also make feel uncomfortable like really want
get out? Well, true beginning deliberate cold exposure protocol,
meaning first week second week third week, one finds
will find deliberate cold exposure consistently will
become comfortable cold temperatures away deliberate cold exposure.
whereas might previously person always cold room
air conditioning, always seeking sweater, always wanting bundle up, will
comfortable cold environments. reason well
substantiated study animal studies whereby deliberate cold exposure
converts one particular kind fat cell, white fat cell, low metabolic

basically storage site. bank account energy. filled lipids,
lipids can used body needs energy goes caloric deficit. Beige fat
brown fat acts sort furnace sort fat find kindle,

beige fat brown fat can increase overall core metabolism, words,
number calories burn per day, therefore number calories
need either maintain lose weight. simple translation getting
cold water total 11 minutes, perhaps more, least 11 minutes per week
divided two four sessions can increase core metabolism part increasing

really interesting. Deliberate cold exposure causes increases

especially important adults babies young children actually don't

terrific way increase core metabolism oftentimes critics will say, well,
increase metabolism isn't significant although want point again,

comfortable cold environments comfortable terms able
combat stress mentally, deliberate cold exposure, believe powerful tool.
simply no reason couldn't shouldn't use protocols
described earlier building resilience increase metabolism. Provided hitting

you, don't worry it. certainly don't need know mechanisms benefit
deliberate cold exposure protocols. names mean something you,
interested exploring downstream effects deliberate cold exposure
something else really nice covered paper deliberate cold
exposure interacts fasted states fed states. think also find review
interesting. don't want go deeply fasted states fed states right now,
suffice say fasted, meaning eaten period
time, baseline levels norepinephrine epinephrine already elevated.
cold exposure times even greater effect metabolism
resilience on. fasters intermittent fasters there, really
want get fancy, can deliberate cold exposure fasted.
certainly wouldn't recommend full stomach case.
mentioned podcast, intermittent fasting is, one way, certainly
ways limit total caloric intake sake maintaining losing weight
goal. know many people using benefit intermittent fasting, however,
certainly can combined deliberate cold exposures order

01:25:55 Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure



get even greater increases norepinephrine epinephrine.
primarily interested using deliberate cold exposure increase dopamine
levels brain body, can also combined protocol whereby ingest
caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold exposure. based study
talked entitled caffeine increases striatal dopamine D-2, D-3
receptor availability human brain. title suggests, study done
humans, looking density efficacy dopamine receptors
area brain called striatum, involved planning action also
suppressing planning action. involved closely whether not can
engage behavior withhold behavior, so-called go no go ways brain.
Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold
exposure? Well, talked earlier, dopamine can increase quite substantially
response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine
case, 300 milligram dose caffeine, dose caffeine
two three cups coffee, depends strength coffee, course,
not outrageous amount caffeine, increases density efficacy
receptors, allow dopamine greatest effect.
want get really, really fancy, suppose fasted get
increase norepinephrine, get dopamine increase cold
exposure, binding dopamine. Although want point
point, start layering together enough protocols spending
entire day trying get dopamine pulse hope
activities engage in, getting morning
fasted haven't eaten night cup coffee, 60
minutes later, take cold shower two hours later, cold immersion
cold shower, layering together different mechanisms
dopamine receptors, epinephrine forth way least me, doesn't seem
incompatible life like going school relationships, et
cetera. increase dopamine, particularly striatum not trivial one.
want point authors preclinical studies shown increases
striatal dopamine induced things like modafinil, used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy, necessary wake promoting actions. really says


just elevated levels dopamine drug ice bath,

01:29:14 Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – Søberg Principle, Shivering

hour ice bath may fasted well quite beneficial
increasing dopamine quite extended periods time. couple key points
want pay attention thinking deliberate cold exposure metabolism.
Søberg study, also explored use sauna use sauna,
meaning deliberate heat conjunction cold. going entire episode
use heat health performance. not focus now, however,
raise important point need address moment,
using sauna taking warm showers simply using
deliberate cold exposure kind, get heat afterward
not all? can point so-called Søberg principle, least call
Søberg principle, Søberg principle named first author study,
referred earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg. science, appropriate take key piece
data call principle fact translates something larger, believe
does. generally not appropriate people name principle
although scientists done that. named Søberg
principle, give appropriate credit Dr. Susanna Søberg,
discovered pointed quite appropriately, achieve greatest
increases metabolism deliberate cold exposure, want force
reheat deliberate cold exposure, meaning wouldn't want go
cold shower hot shower cold shower sauna. Rather
going start hot shower going start sauna
end cold, reheat naturally. Now personally take cold
shower times week cold immersion not specifically


focused increasing metabolism, although probably be, not
using now, will take hot shower afterwards so, short circuiting
metabolic increases achieve just end
cold. Søberg principle want increase metabolism, end cold,
can take step say want use deliberate cold
exposure increase metabolism, make sure get point
shiver. reason series studies,
particular, one study published journal Nature, excellent journal year 2018,
showing deliberate cold exposure evokes shivering muscles causes
release molecule called succinate muscles succinate plays
key role activating brown fat thermogenesis, now heard
understand critical increases metabolism caused deliberate cold
exposure. means want increase metabolism, end cold,
Søberg principle best can, try get point
shivering either cold exposure immediately afterwards. Now one
efficient way to, instance, get cold shower minute
two minutes three minutes, uncomfortably cold, safe stay in. Remember
general rule thumb. turn off water stand there, make sure
not holding close body, not hugging try
keep warm, rather limbs extended sides.
fails induce shiver turn cold water again, turn off again,
alternating perhaps minute three minutes cold exposure followed minute
three minutes drying air going back cold exposure, et cetera. can
tell experience, pretty brutal protocol. never tried
getting ice bath cold water immersion shower one minute
getting trying stand arms extended cool cold air one
minute, getting back cold shower water immersion,
experience even pretty shiver resistant, find
much, much harder get cold water stand arms extended
drying off evaporation, draws heat body wrap
towel, get warm shower sauna. certainly no requirement
end cold. certainly no requirement induce shiver, primary goal
induce increases metabolism, short term long term,
following cold exposure, well want end cold want find


way shiver

01:36:22 Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation

norepinephrine signals changing fat cells way
metabolize energy. Now like shift attention use deliberate cold
exposure sake physical performance. lot opinions


use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint
interval training weight workout main focus performance
movements skill training workout main focus performance
movements, no reason think cold water immersion ice
bath cold shower inhibit progress stimulus lead
progress occurred training session. words, don't see
reason based literature avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately
training, unless goal hypertrophy strength. fact,
nice review recently published deliberate cold exposure can impact
physical performance, whether not done after, different types training
forth. paper entitled impact cold water immersion compared
passive recovery, following single strenuous exercise athletic performance
physically active participants, systematic review meta-analysis meta
regression. meta-analysis 52 studies looked tremendous number
variables contexts, expect meta-analysis 52 studies.
going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high
intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose
response relationships things like endurance training, meaning longer cold
exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms

given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance

second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.

days weeks. Now attractive way approach things, problem
don't infinite amount room lower temperature,
eventually will get temperatures either cold dangerous
stay cold temperatures long periods becomes
impractical presumably also take care aspects life,
can't just sit day ice bath. Now reason, favor protocol
build mental resilience mental toughness two different types
protocols. first one involves counting walls. Now, mean walls? mean
sensation of, no, don't want idea sensation brain
body actually want leave environment go warm up. Now again,
people, will even getting ice bath cold shower.
feeling resistant getting ice bath cold shower manage


that, going call one wall. period time,
might actually feel comfortable ice bath, cold water cold shower. feel
like stay period time, stay minute
two minutes, inevitably, next wall will arrive. encourage pay
attention next wall arrives actually awareness, so-called
interceptive awareness call it, next surge adrenaline epinephrine
comes whether not reaches certain threshold brain body
feel want get able stay even just 10 seconds longer,
means traversed yet another wall. continue stay cold
environment, find next wall will come next wall will come. Now
eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting
designated number walls start protocol going beneficial
here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different

box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water

Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results

will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely

used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play

course one significantly volume, not experiencing delayed

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

eventually course, will get very, numb depending cold
also place danger. maintain cognitive control,
counting walls, traversing walls, getting point, course.
favorite protocol building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, take
account days, just getting ice bath cold shower represents
wall, days doesn't. days get feel go 10 minutes,
days get feel like go minute setting

here. say, long can safely, going three walls today. first
wall getting in. second wall will arrive arrives third wall will arrive
arrives get wall get out. next day, might
five walls. next day, might three walls again, might lower
temperature. gives tremendous flexibility indeed gives much
latitude able use temperatures different ways, reduce
temperature little bit still get lot stimulus, meaning lot results
given protocol. Whereas people just going temperature time eventually
become cold adapted. get very, good three minutes six minutes
even 10 minutes given temperature feel like lower
temperature even even eventually just bought out.
nowhere else go. no way get improvements protocol.
least not terms mental resilience. course, still positive effects
inflammation metabolism, et cetera, talk little bit. key
thing design protocols going work time
very, hardy, very, tough guys gals can get right ice


bath very, cold immersion can just grind six 10 minutes,
can even remaining peaceful, well points you, guess what?
equivalent already loaded barbell 600 pounds done

staying calm clear mind, can really imagine ice

00:50:57 Optimal Mindset(s) Cold Exposure

forms cold exposure really serving train real life stressors.
next question always get mental state exposing
uncomfortable, yet safe condition cold? Well, two options


probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees
Celsius, 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees
Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius, 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. not super cold,
measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention
feelings wellbeing mood people typically experience deliberate
cold exposure. reason say go back episode
dopamine, go back episode Dr. Anna
Lembke addiction dopamine, find increases dopamine
sort evoked deliberate cold exposure actually similar kinds
increases dopamine elicited things like nicotine behaviors
known addictive bad us lead effects
brain body simply don't want. yet deliberate cold exposure provided
done safely can create similar not greater increases dopamine not just
fleeting, don't just occur during, say consumption deleterious drug
activity, long lasting can leveraged toward activities
deliberate cold exposure. want emphasize this. not suggesting
people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say
one minute three minutes six minutes 55 degrees 50 degrees, whether
not leads similar, greater reduced levels dopamine brain body.
yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,
stressful. didn't enjoy it, eventually grew like it, always feel better
afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine
concert increases norepinephrine also explain effect
commonly reported, enhancement mental acuity ability focus.
Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part
episode, talking use short 15 minute exercise, kind moderate
intensity exercise shown increase levels energy mental

assume somewhat weren't neurochemical measurements,
can reasonably assume improvements cognitive performance due

not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck

hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold

increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,

pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures

improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet

one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

Now commercial technology. know people started

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold

body, lowering core body temperature words. find
see enormous increases total number dips people can do, doesn't
mean person goes able 40 dips, able 50 dips
60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play

course one significantly volume, not experiencing delayed

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
deliberate cold exposure prepared fairly alert next one

probably options well. One try calm remain
mentally still possible. lean challenge grind
here, say lot like teaching someone drive gravel road.
driven gravel road, know no optimal
speed gravel roads. depends density gravel, et cetera,
vehicle, et cetera. instance, gravel roads, start drive
dust starts kick up, best option drive fast put dust cloud behind you.
gravel roads, try that, dust actually kicks around
vehicle makes hard see sometimes slow down.
thing true getting deliberate cold exposure. Sometimes easier calm
yourself. One way double inhales nose extended
exhales mouth, simply trying control breathing reduce
pace breath increase volume breathing. say
everyone experiences shortening breath get uncomfortably cold
water, universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences 30
80% decrease cognitive function, particular, frontal cortex. metabolism
frontal cortex goes down, metabolism meaning activity brain areas
associated stress panic goes way up. anchoring mind cognitive
activities get cold can very, helpful maintaining clarity mind.
fact, one thing sometimes recommend people try engage
sort cognitive exercise cold, not form distraction, way
maintain clarity thinking learn body flooded
chemicals make us stressed. instance, math problems
not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, things
require little bit focus attention working memory forth. also
start thoughts deliberately impose full sentence structure on.
actually quite tough. try recall specific bouts information
challenging. teaching mind stay online, rather say,
teaching prefrontal cortex, stay engaged high levels
stress body. Years ago, friend works neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist, obsessed bizarre sport don't
necessarily recommend all, combination boxing chess. may
seen YouTube people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
sparring often. end round, instead resting


corner, actually sit play chess, go back boxing back
chess. Again, not sport recommend, reason obsessed
studies impact stress cognitive performance.
particular bizarre sport toggling back forth different
states mind. Now used increase cognitive clarity fighter
box, staying calm clear thinking important winning boxing
matches. Believe not, not outrage. calculated game mental
chess physical chess quite high stakes can imagine. also used
circles way teach people engage cognitive performance
body simply filled stress. boxing chess example, replacement
cold water actually boxing, thing supposed induce
stress cause getting hit stressful risk getting hit stressful people.
again, think deliberate cold exposure way just systematically
reliably inducing epinephrine norepinephrine release delivering stress, well
idea maintaining cognitive clarity actually engaging cognitive tasks
ice bath cold shower can actually beneficial. Even though might sound
little bit silly, really training ability keep brain working

00:55:26 Tool: Using Movement Cold Exposure

reflex shut parts brain involved deliberate
planning thinking. Now another important aspect deliberate cold exposure
rarely ever hear discussed, vitally important whether not move around
not. reason. get cold water remain
period time, body generating heat heat generates called
thermal layer surrounds entire body. stay still, actually
warmer move around, can try next time
deliberate cold exposure. submerged neck, sit 10, 30
seconds very, still body. fact, way people start
deliberate cold exposure. give stoic look. don't blink, look
peaceful. even look tough make even A, emotional
face looks like really tough, still believe not,
not providing potent stimulus. move around
water, happen break thermal layer actually


experience much colder. really want push resilience aspect,
instance, want use given temperature comfortable in,
want increase stimulus want get benefit mental
resilience training, well get cold water, move body around
continuously, try keep mind still, even sort cognitive task.
starting realize, bunch different variables can play
maintaining temperature water so, really keep
zone absolutely safe without just
continually drop temperature say 60 degrees 55 40 33
mentioned before, eventually going bottom out. one people
likes look tough really relaxed ice bath cold water
immersion, just realize actually cheating part stimulus.
Keep limbs moving course, limbs water, feet hands going
potent stimulus hands feet reasons obvious
based talked terms glabrous skin cooling. Keep
submerged, move body,

00:57:51 Optimal Frequency Cold Exposure

maybe move knees down, pedal feet trust me, going feel
lot colder remain stone still. Another common question
often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going
ice bath cold immersion cold shower one minute, others will
10 minutes, depending frequent high, will, walls
adrenaline coming. you, getting cold shower three
minutes total whole week will represent tremendous achievement terms
willpower overcoming resistance that, overcoming walls.


others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold
shower immersion, going easily, cruising basically.
say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate
cold exposure three times week using walls method described earlier
gauge long stay typically means staying
anywhere two minutes six minutes per session averages 11
15 minutes total per week. again, not think need super strict
guidelines. important embracing protocol A,
safely, secondarily consistently. find can consistently
vary parameters will allow continue deliberate cold
exposure consistently,

01:00:22 Cold Exposure Dopamine, Mood & Focus

regardless whether not access shower cold immersion, et cetera.
talking mental effects use deliberate cold exposure
sake building resilience, believe can tremendously powerful. Look,
no coincidence screening training Navy Seals involves lot
exposure cold water. One argue deliberate elect go
buds, get cold water buds dictated instructors
reason use cold water exposure stressor offer considerable
leeway terms duration temperature, terms can use
stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space say. isn't
lot room beyond start injuring even killing people using heat.
lot forms stressors there, cold one can titrate,
can adjust ways can allow us continually build maintain mental
toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also many effects chemicals
norepinephrine epinephrine, notably neuromodulator dopamine,
involved elevating mood, making us feel energized enhancing


ability focus. lot dopamine engages us motivated
states, tends narrow thinking behavior particular trench goal-
directed behavior. want learn dopamine, can learn lot
dopamine episode dopamine, hubermanlab.com. can find it,
two half hour plus kind deep dive things dopamine, focus, motivation, et
cetera. Deliberate cold exposure powerful effect release dopamine
brain body. one main reasons people continue
deliberate cold exposure. Basically makes us feel good continues make us
feel good even get cold environment. fact, people say
don't feel good cold environment, stress them, afterwards
feel great. One previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, medical doctor
Stanford University School Medicine, close colleague mine, described
use dopamine book, Dopamine Nation, incredible book addiction
dopamine mention. use dopamine elicited cold water exposure
one patients. referring fact one patients helped
get stay sober off drugs using deliberate cold exposure increase
dopamine. healthier form dopamine release engaged prior
getting sober. Now, basis dopamine release response cold exposure
catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine tend co-released
sorts stimuli, stressors particular things evoke stress
feelings stress internally don't like not increase dopamine.
increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees
Celsius, 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees
Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius, 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. not super cold,
measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like
norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, serum meaning within blood.


really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention
feelings wellbeing mood people typically experience deliberate
cold exposure. reason say go back episode
dopamine, go back episode Dr. Anna
Lembke addiction dopamine, find increases dopamine
sort evoked deliberate cold exposure actually similar kinds
increases dopamine elicited things like nicotine behaviors
known addictive bad us lead effects
brain body simply don't want. yet deliberate cold exposure provided
done safely can create similar not greater increases dopamine not just
fleeting, don't just occur during, say consumption deleterious drug
activity, long lasting can leveraged toward activities
deliberate cold exposure. want emphasize this. not suggesting
people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say
one minute three minutes six minutes 55 degrees 50 degrees, whether
not leads similar, greater reduced levels dopamine brain body.
yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,
stressful. didn't enjoy it, eventually grew like it, always feel better
afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine
concert increases norepinephrine also explain effect
commonly reported, enhancement mental acuity ability focus.
Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part
episode, talking use short 15 minute exercise, kind moderate
intensity exercise shown increase levels energy mental
acuity working memory, visual attention tasks. there, again,
assume somewhat weren't neurochemical measurements,
can reasonably assume improvements cognitive performance due

earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes discomfort experience
norepinephrine release, least short term, say, well, shouldn't
deliberate cold exposure also make feel uncomfortable like really want

goal. know many people using benefit intermittent fasting, however,
certainly can combined deliberate cold exposures order

01:25:55 Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure



get even greater increases norepinephrine epinephrine.
primarily interested using deliberate cold exposure increase dopamine
levels brain body, can also combined protocol whereby ingest
caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold exposure. based study
talked entitled caffeine increases striatal dopamine D-2, D-3
receptor availability human brain. title suggests, study done
humans, looking density efficacy dopamine receptors
area brain called striatum, involved planning action also
suppressing planning action. involved closely whether not can
engage behavior withhold behavior, so-called go no go ways brain.
Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold
exposure? Well, talked earlier, dopamine can increase quite substantially
response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine
case, 300 milligram dose caffeine, dose caffeine
two three cups coffee, depends strength coffee, course,
not outrageous amount caffeine, increases density efficacy
receptors, allow dopamine greatest effect.
want get really, really fancy, suppose fasted get

literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy

four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck

hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount

particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet

one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest

wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going

honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold

inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day

early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon

often deliberate cold exposure. tough make recommendation based
peer reviewed study although humans point threshold
11 minutes total per week. total throughout week divided two four
sessions two three minutes so. Now 11 minute cutoff not strict threshold
actually geared towards increases metabolism, get little bit
later episode, think 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total
deliberate cold exposure per week pretty good number use need number
order keep consistent. talked earlier, going

others you, three minutes nothing. recommend, recommend
get least 11 minutes total per week, point 11 minutes total per week
easy you, no longer representing significant mental challenge,
meaning not experiencing many walls, excited get cold

say either lower temperature safely, course, extend duration safely, course,
increase frequency perhaps every day maybe five days
week three days week. personally get tremendous benefit deliberate

increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water

Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part

literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical

discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint

beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms
performance, talk moment, need use cool object
surface not cold causes vasoconstriction. can little bit
tough dial in, meaning can tough identify object. reason,


Dr. Heller colleagues developed commercial product called
CoolMitt. can actually go website, coolmitt.com. don't financial
relationship them. know developing technology
period time. involves glove put hand into, circulates water
given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance
volume strength training people can conduct appropriately cool
body glabrous skin portals actually quite significant. again,
relates hyperthermia, someone overheating means, try get
heat, get stop exercising, can die hyperthermia, try cool
bottoms feet, palms hands upper portion face.
not mean bad idea put cold water top head.
probably also help perhaps neck. probably not going

Heller shares episode earlier, can find
hubermanlab.com involves someone coming sets dips, maybe 40 dips.
person actually 40 dips first set, resting period two

progressively fewer fewer fewer point period

mean person goes able 40 dips, able 50 dips
60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling

take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

increase norepinephrine epinephrine, deliberate cold exposure seems cause
dramatic increase dopamine. actually substantiated really
beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal
Applied Physiology year 2000, really beautiful study, love study.
took people sit chairs underwater head
immersed neck either three different temperatures. 32 degrees

really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects

long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining

actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced

dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine

stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting

people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say

yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,

afterwards feeling last long period time. think almost
certain experiences people report relate increases dopamine

Now, can extrapolate study discussed early part

Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold

response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine

01:29:14 Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – Søberg Principle, Shivering

hour ice bath may fasted well quite beneficial
increasing dopamine quite extended periods time. couple key points
want pay attention thinking deliberate cold exposure metabolism.
Søberg study, also explored use sauna use sauna,
meaning deliberate heat conjunction cold. going entire episode
use heat health performance. not focus now, however,
raise important point need address moment,
using sauna taking warm showers simply using
deliberate cold exposure kind, get heat afterward
not all? can point so-called Søberg principle, least call
Søberg principle, Søberg principle named first author study,
referred earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg. science, appropriate take key piece

does. generally not appropriate people name principle
although scientists done that. named Søberg
principle, give appropriate credit Dr. Susanna Søberg,
discovered pointed quite appropriately, achieve greatest
increases metabolism deliberate cold exposure, want force
reheat deliberate cold exposure, meaning wouldn't want go
cold shower hot shower cold shower sauna. Rather
going start hot shower going start sauna
end cold, reheat naturally. Now personally take cold
shower times week cold immersion not specifically


focused increasing metabolism, although probably be, not
using now, will take hot shower afterwards so, short circuiting
metabolic increases achieve just end
cold. Søberg principle want increase metabolism, end cold,
can take step say want use deliberate cold
exposure increase metabolism, make sure get point
shiver. reason series studies,
particular, one study published journal Nature, excellent journal year 2018,
showing deliberate cold exposure evokes shivering muscles causes
release molecule called succinate muscles succinate plays
key role activating brown fat thermogenesis, now heard
understand critical increases metabolism caused deliberate cold
exposure. means want increase metabolism, end cold,
Søberg principle best can, try get point
shivering either cold exposure immediately afterwards. Now one
efficient way to, instance, get cold shower minute
two minutes three minutes, uncomfortably cold, safe stay in. Remember
general rule thumb. turn off water stand there, make sure
not holding close body, not hugging try
keep warm, rather limbs extended sides.
fails induce shiver turn cold water again, turn off again,
alternating perhaps minute three minutes cold exposure followed minute
three minutes drying air going back cold exposure, et cetera. can
tell experience, pretty brutal protocol. never tried
getting ice bath cold water immersion shower one minute
getting trying stand arms extended cool cold air one
minute, getting back cold shower water immersion,

now, talking deliberate cold exposure potent stimulus

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint
interval training weight workout main focus performance
movements skill training workout main focus performance
movements, no reason think cold water immersion ice
bath cold shower inhibit progress stimulus lead
progress occurred training session. words, don't see
reason based literature avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately
training, unless goal hypertrophy strength. fact,
nice review recently published deliberate cold exposure can impact
physical performance, whether not done after, different types training
forth. paper entitled impact cold water immersion compared
passive recovery, following single strenuous exercise athletic performance
physically active participants, systematic review meta-analysis meta
regression. meta-analysis 52 studies looked tremendous number
variables contexts, expect meta-analysis 52 studies.
going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high
intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose
response relationships things like endurance training, meaning longer cold
exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link

can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits

palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside

study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain

Now commercial technology. know people started

second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day

evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing

beautiful study entitled human physiological responses immersion water
different temperatures. first author Sramek. almost certainly pronouncing
poorly not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. published European Journal

measured people's core body temperature throughout.
measured metabolism looked serum levels things like

really nice quite thorough study. not huge number subjects
study, nonetheless, thorough study terms number
variables explored. just want briefly highlight saw
observed study. First all, groups water given
temperature one hour, much longer deliberate cold
exposure protocols anyone using home. mean, maybe taking one hour
long cold showers, maybe getting ice bath hour although don't
recommend that. think probably get badly hypothermic maybe getting
cold water immersion period time, hard time imagining
hour don't suggest cold. study focused
actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not think people
consider very, cold temperatures, extended duration quite while.
again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius 14 degree Celsius.
observed. group immersed neck 32 degrees Celsius, 89
degrees Fahrenheit, water not experience shift metabolism significant
increase dopamine, norepinephrine catecholamines. group
20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water hour experienced
93% increase metabolic rate, remarkable given water wasn't
cold yet hour pretty long time there. again, speaks
dramatic effect heat transfer water has, mentioned earlier, opposed
air 68 degrees, certainly not cause increase metabolic
rate. group 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
water hour experienced 350% increase metabolism. huge increases
metabolism. Now interesting data me, least terms mental effects
deliberate cold exposure, plasma serum levels norepinephrine
blood increased 530%. huge increases norepinephrine suggests
stressful stimulus least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite fact
not super super cold, although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius
not warm environment, not ultra, ultra cold environment, hour
long time there. subjects also experienced 250% increase dopamine
concentrations, not 530% norepinephrine still large
increase baseline levels dopamine. interesting
increases dopamine persisted long period time afterwards, even
two hours. stopped study 120 minutes getting cold,


nonetheless, increases norepinephrine huge long lasting
increases dopamine large long lasting. believe
documented effects humans explain much enhancement attention

people deliberate cold exposure hour day. unfortunately not
many studies yet exploring shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say

not leads similar, greater reduced levels dopamine brain body.
yet almost everybody deliberate cold exposure will say yeah,

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one

press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular

really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone

say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold

testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold

interesting. don't want go deeply fasted states fed states right now,
suffice say fasted, meaning eaten period

certainly can combined deliberate cold exposures order

01:25:55 Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure



get even greater increases norepinephrine epinephrine.
primarily interested using deliberate cold exposure increase dopamine

humans, looking density efficacy dopamine receptors
area brain called striatum, involved planning action also
suppressing planning action. involved closely whether not can
engage behavior withhold behavior, so-called go no go ways brain.
Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold

response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine
case, 300 milligram dose caffeine, dose caffeine
two three cups coffee, depends strength coffee, course,
not outrageous amount caffeine, increases density efficacy

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy

not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact

going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high

variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose

exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature

sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

interesting. don't want go deeply fasted states fed states right now,
suffice say fasted, meaning eaten period

01:25:55 Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure



get even greater increases norepinephrine epinephrine.
primarily interested using deliberate cold exposure increase dopamine

humans, looking density efficacy dopamine receptors
area brain called striatum, involved planning action also
suppressing planning action. involved closely whether not can
engage behavior withhold behavior, so-called go no go ways brain.
Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold

response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine
case, 300 milligram dose caffeine, dose caffeine
two three cups coffee, depends strength coffee, course,
not outrageous amount caffeine, increases density efficacy

focused increasing metabolism, although probably be, not
using now, will take hot shower afterwards so, short circuiting
metabolic increases achieve just end
cold. Søberg principle want increase metabolism, end cold,
can take step say want use deliberate cold

shiver. reason series studies,
particular, one study published journal Nature, excellent journal year 2018,
showing deliberate cold exposure evokes shivering muscles causes
release molecule called succinate muscles succinate plays
key role activating brown fat thermogenesis, now heard
understand critical increases metabolism caused deliberate cold

Søberg principle best can, try get point
shivering either cold exposure immediately afterwards. Now one
efficient way to, instance, get cold shower minute
two minutes three minutes, uncomfortably cold, safe stay in. Remember
general rule thumb. turn off water stand there, make sure
not holding close body, not hugging try
keep warm, rather limbs extended sides.
fails induce shiver turn cold water again, turn off again,
alternating perhaps minute three minutes cold exposure followed minute
three minutes drying air going back cold exposure, et cetera. can

provided level cold exposing still safe overall.
now, talking deliberate cold exposure potent stimulus

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint

going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high

variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose

reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief

inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared

point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not

bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands

temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms
performance, talk moment, need use cool object
surface not cold causes vasoconstriction. can little bit
tough dial in, meaning can tough identify object. reason,


Dr. Heller colleagues developed commercial product called
CoolMitt. can actually go website, coolmitt.com. don't financial
relationship them. know developing technology
period time. involves glove put hand into, circulates water
given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance
volume strength training people can conduct appropriately cool
body glabrous skin portals actually quite significant. again,
relates hyperthermia, someone overheating means, try get
heat, get stop exercising, can die hyperthermia, try cool
bottoms feet, palms hands upper portion face.
not mean bad idea put cold water top head.
probably also help perhaps neck. probably not going

Heller shares episode earlier, can find
hubermanlab.com involves someone coming sets dips, maybe 40 dips.
person actually 40 dips first set, resting period two
three minutes 35 resting period two three minutes,
progressively fewer fewer fewer point period

mean person goes able 40 dips, able 50 dips
60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
deliberate cold exposure prepared fairly alert next one

earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes discomfort experience
norepinephrine release, least short term, say, well, shouldn't
deliberate cold exposure also make feel uncomfortable like really want
get out? Well, true beginning deliberate cold exposure protocol,
meaning first week second week third week, one finds
will find deliberate cold exposure consistently will
become comfortable cold temperatures away deliberate cold exposure.
whereas might previously person always cold room

interesting. don't want go deeply fasted states fed states right now,
suffice say fasted, meaning eaten period
time, baseline levels norepinephrine epinephrine already elevated.
cold exposure times even greater effect metabolism
resilience on. fasters intermittent fasters there, really
want get fancy, can deliberate cold exposure fasted.
certainly wouldn't recommend full stomach case.
mentioned podcast, intermittent fasting is, one way, certainly
ways limit total caloric intake sake maintaining losing weight
goal. know many people using benefit intermittent fasting, however,
certainly can combined deliberate cold exposures order

01:25:55 Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure



get even greater increases norepinephrine epinephrine.
primarily interested using deliberate cold exposure increase dopamine
levels brain body, can also combined protocol whereby ingest
caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold exposure. based study
talked entitled caffeine increases striatal dopamine D-2, D-3
receptor availability human brain. title suggests, study done
humans, looking density efficacy dopamine receptors
area brain called striatum, involved planning action also
suppressing planning action. involved closely whether not can
engage behavior withhold behavior, so-called go no go ways brain.
Dopamine plays critical role many things well now know.
want ingest caffeine 60 120 minutes deliberate cold
exposure? Well, talked earlier, dopamine can increase quite substantially
response deliberate cold exposure, dopamine doesn't anything,
bind receptors paper shows quite definitively ingesting caffeine
case, 300 milligram dose caffeine, dose caffeine
two three cups coffee, depends strength coffee, course,
not outrageous amount caffeine, increases density efficacy
receptors, allow dopamine greatest effect.
want get really, really fancy, suppose fasted get
increase norepinephrine, get dopamine increase cold
exposure, binding dopamine. Although want point
point, start layering together enough protocols spending
entire day trying get dopamine pulse hope
activities engage in, getting morning
fasted haven't eaten night cup coffee, 60
minutes later, take cold shower two hours later, cold immersion
cold shower, layering together different mechanisms
dopamine receptors, epinephrine forth way least me, doesn't seem
incompatible life like going school relationships, et
cetera. increase dopamine, particularly striatum not trivial one.
want point authors preclinical studies shown increases
striatal dopamine induced things like modafinil, used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy, necessary wake promoting actions. really says


just elevated levels dopamine drug ice bath,
not sufficient get effects dopamine, really need receptors

01:29:14 Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – Søberg Principle, Shivering

hour ice bath may fasted well quite beneficial
increasing dopamine quite extended periods time. couple key points
want pay attention thinking deliberate cold exposure metabolism.
Søberg study, also explored use sauna use sauna,
meaning deliberate heat conjunction cold. going entire episode
use heat health performance. not focus now, however,
raise important point need address moment,
using sauna taking warm showers simply using
deliberate cold exposure kind, get heat afterward
not all? can point so-called Søberg principle, least call
Søberg principle, Søberg principle named first author study,
referred earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg. science, appropriate take key piece
data call principle fact translates something larger, believe
does. generally not appropriate people name principle
although scientists done that. named Søberg
principle, give appropriate credit Dr. Susanna Søberg,
discovered pointed quite appropriately, achieve greatest
increases metabolism deliberate cold exposure, want force
reheat deliberate cold exposure, meaning wouldn't want go
cold shower hot shower cold shower sauna. Rather
going start hot shower going start sauna
end cold, reheat naturally. Now personally take cold
shower times week cold immersion not specifically


focused increasing metabolism, although probably be, not
using now, will take hot shower afterwards so, short circuiting
metabolic increases achieve just end
cold. Søberg principle want increase metabolism, end cold,
can take step say want use deliberate cold
exposure increase metabolism, make sure get point
shiver. reason series studies,
particular, one study published journal Nature, excellent journal year 2018,
showing deliberate cold exposure evokes shivering muscles causes
release molecule called succinate muscles succinate plays
key role activating brown fat thermogenesis, now heard
understand critical increases metabolism caused deliberate cold
exposure. means want increase metabolism, end cold,
Søberg principle best can, try get point
shivering either cold exposure immediately afterwards. Now one
efficient way to, instance, get cold shower minute
two minutes three minutes, uncomfortably cold, safe stay in. Remember
general rule thumb. turn off water stand there, make sure
not holding close body, not hugging try
keep warm, rather limbs extended sides.
fails induce shiver turn cold water again, turn off again,
alternating perhaps minute three minutes cold exposure followed minute
three minutes drying air going back cold exposure, et cetera. can
tell experience, pretty brutal protocol. never tried
getting ice bath cold water immersion shower one minute
getting trying stand arms extended cool cold air one
minute, getting back cold shower water immersion,
experience even pretty shiver resistant, find
much, much harder get cold water stand arms extended
drying off evaporation, draws heat body wrap
towel, get warm shower sauna. certainly no requirement
end cold. certainly no requirement induce shiver, primary goal
induce increases metabolism, short term long term,
following cold exposure, well want end cold want find


way shiver

01:34:15 Norepinephrine & Fat Cells

provided level cold exposing still safe overall.
now, talking deliberate cold exposure potent stimulus
release norepinephrine brain body indeed is, way
describing context circulating plasma levels norepinephrine,
meaning circulating within blood. haven't mentioned, absolutely true
fat cells actually receive input neurons. neurons
release norepinephrine response cold, directly fat. want give
picture architecture works, think can help
navigate indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols. adrenal glands
release norepinephrine epinephrine. brain sites within like locus
coeruleus release norepinephrine epinephrine, also neurons
within skin sense cold neurons can directly release
norepinephrine fat stores cause white fat cells convert beige
brown fat. think particular aspect physiology often overlooked
studies. people say, oh, well increases metabolism aren't great,
circulating levels norepinephrine, large, transient
on, fails understand neurons actually sense cold position
communicate via neurons directly fat cells release norepinephrine
fat cells, pointed earlier, set off huge set immediate long
term cascades even gene expression changes. picture like
mind get cold, yes, course experience
experience don't want this, going overcome this, going climb
mental walls represent adrenaline release brain body, also
fat cells receiving signals,

01:36:22 Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation

norepinephrine signals changing fat cells way
metabolize energy. Now like shift attention use deliberate cold
exposure sake physical performance. lot opinions


use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint

beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link

brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40

home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits

Now commercial technology. know people started

second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day

sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon

easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted

increases metabolism deliberate cold exposure, want force
reheat deliberate cold exposure, meaning wouldn't want go
cold shower hot shower cold shower sauna. Rather
going start hot shower going start sauna
end cold, reheat naturally. Now personally take cold
shower times week cold immersion not specifically


focused increasing metabolism, although probably be, not
using now, will take hot shower afterwards so, short circuiting
metabolic increases achieve just end
cold. Søberg principle want increase metabolism, end cold,
can take step say want use deliberate cold

shiver. reason series studies,
particular, one study published journal Nature, excellent journal year 2018,
showing deliberate cold exposure evokes shivering muscles causes
release molecule called succinate muscles succinate plays
key role activating brown fat thermogenesis, now heard
understand critical increases metabolism caused deliberate cold

Søberg principle best can, try get point
shivering either cold exposure immediately afterwards. Now one
efficient way to, instance, get cold shower minute
two minutes three minutes, uncomfortably cold, safe stay in. Remember
general rule thumb. turn off water stand there, make sure
not holding close body, not hugging try
keep warm, rather limbs extended sides.
fails induce shiver turn cold water again, turn off again,
alternating perhaps minute three minutes cold exposure followed minute
three minutes drying air going back cold exposure, et cetera. can

01:34:15 Norepinephrine & Fat Cells

provided level cold exposing still safe overall.
now, talking deliberate cold exposure potent stimulus
release norepinephrine brain body indeed is, way
describing context circulating plasma levels norepinephrine,
meaning circulating within blood. haven't mentioned, absolutely true
fat cells actually receive input neurons. neurons
release norepinephrine response cold, directly fat. want give

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours

beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount

minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum

may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,

findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs

brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever

cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number

way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body

surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started

second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.

neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers

taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet

one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,

Now commercial technology. know people started

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.

01:34:15 Norepinephrine & Fat Cells

provided level cold exposing still safe overall.
now, talking deliberate cold exposure potent stimulus

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint
interval training weight workout main focus performance
movements skill training workout main focus performance
movements, no reason think cold water immersion ice
bath cold shower inhibit progress stimulus lead
progress occurred training session. words, don't see
reason based literature avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately
training, unless goal hypertrophy strength. fact,
nice review recently published deliberate cold exposure can impact
physical performance, whether not done after, different types training
forth. paper entitled impact cold water immersion compared
passive recovery, following single strenuous exercise athletic performance
physically active participants, systematic review meta-analysis meta
regression. meta-analysis 52 studies looked tremendous number
variables contexts, expect meta-analysis 52 studies.
going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high
intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose
response relationships things like endurance training, meaning longer cold
exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day

one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing

scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical

discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk

neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers

again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform

mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going

use deliberate cold, whether not done instance,
exercise, whether not done immediately strength training hypertrophy
training, meaning training designed grow muscles make stronger, whether
not can inhibit process forth. think today looking
literature trying bring forward simplest straightforward, yet
scientifically grounded protocols, can set general guidelines will allow
most, not, still extract benefits deliberate cold exposure physical
performance without getting neurotic exact timing, sake
discussion prominent theme many online communities, just
start big one there, meaning question whether not ice bath
deliberate cold exposure taking cold shower strength slash
hypertrophy training, meaning training designed increase strength say
size muscles will somehow short circuit diminish process, whether not
will reduce eliminate strength gains hypertrophy gains. short
answer able arrive basis review article talk
moment studies well, main goal hypertrophy
strength, probably best avoid cold water immersion ice bath immersion
four hours immediately following strength hypertrophy training. Again,
main goal achieve hypertrophy strength combination those, probably
best avoid cold water immersion neck ice bath immersion neck
immediately strength hypertrophy training extending four
hours training. really neurotic this, perhaps want
move cold water exposure different day entirely, depends
neurotically attached getting every last bit strength hypertrophy.
goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours
away training going necessary you. Now notice not talk
cold showers reason not talk cold showers simply
not many studies deliberate cold exposure cold showers
reasons talked beginning episode. hard imagine
taking brief cold shower strength hypertrophy training session
completely reverse short circuit effects strength hypertrophy training.
again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength
hypertrophy training sessions, means, err side caution
wait four hours cold shower just wait four hours


cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact

going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high

high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures

thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

goal, terrific, well probably moving cold exposure four hours

again, neurotically attached getting every last bit strength

going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold

variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,

creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures

soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms
performance, talk moment, need use cool object
surface not cold causes vasoconstriction. can little bit
tough dial in, meaning can tough identify object. reason,


Dr. Heller colleagues developed commercial product called
CoolMitt. can actually go website, coolmitt.com. don't financial
relationship them. know developing technology
period time. involves glove put hand into, circulates water
given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance
volume strength training people can conduct appropriately cool
body glabrous skin portals actually quite significant. again,
relates hyperthermia, someone overheating means, try get
heat, get stop exercising, can die hyperthermia, try cool
bottoms feet, palms hands upper portion face.
not mean bad idea put cold water top head.
probably also help perhaps neck. probably not going

think, well, not possible. Effects instance, documented
showing doubling tripling number dips one can relatively short

performance enhancing drugs, et cetera, et cetera. Part confusion
effects proper palmer cooling, almost always done palmer cooling

people not palmer cooling receiving cooling way
cold compress back neck ice pack armpits, et cetera.
effects palmer cooling clear robust. context endurance
exercise almost always allow people work, go longer less perceived
effort quit later speak. terms strength training, looked
capacity perform sets dips. one famous examples Dr.
Heller shares episode earlier, can find
hubermanlab.com involves someone coming sets dips, maybe 40 dips.
person actually 40 dips first set, resting period two
three minutes 35 resting period two three minutes,
progressively fewer fewer fewer point period
time, add total number dips can
come back period recovery, not immediately after, take couple
days, come back effectively protocol, rest periods,
two minutes palmer cooling, essentially allows heat move
body, lowering core body temperature words. find
see enormous increases total number dips people can do, doesn't
mean person goes able 40 dips, able 50 dips
60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play
phone sets. another deliberate cooling palms
bottom feet upper portion face. might get weird looks,
course one significantly volume, not experiencing delayed
onset muscle soreness achieving

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,

early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing

simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

cold water immersion. Now nice data pointing fact
cold water immersion hard run, endurance training, even sprint
interval training weight workout main focus performance
movements skill training workout main focus performance
movements, no reason think cold water immersion ice
bath cold shower inhibit progress stimulus lead
progress occurred training session. words, don't see
reason based literature avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately
training, unless goal hypertrophy strength. fact,
nice review recently published deliberate cold exposure can impact
physical performance, whether not done after, different types training
forth. paper entitled impact cold water immersion compared
passive recovery, following single strenuous exercise athletic performance
physically active participants, systematic review meta-analysis meta
regression. meta-analysis 52 studies looked tremendous number
variables contexts, expect meta-analysis 52 studies.
going read conclusions study will provide link. certainly don't
time go details study. will highlight specific
outcomes found particularly interesting, paraphrasing
conclusions, cold water immersion, want emphasize immersion, not cold
showers, cold water immersion say effective recovery tool high
intensity exercise. observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements certain
variables, muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness,
increased muscular power, perceived recovery 24 hours exercise. However,
certain forms exercise not benefited cold water immersion,
eccentric exercise, exercise focusing lowering component so-
called eccentric component resistance exercise. saw entry dose
response relationships things like endurance training, meaning longer cold
exposure post-endurance training, improvement endurance performance,
reductions circulating creatine kinases things relate muscle damage
certain conditions. point future, way, entire episode
creatine creatine kinase, important not just muscular function, also
brain function. basic takeaway cold water immersion performed
high intensity exercise beneficial number different standpoints


indicated shorter duration, cold exposure lower temperatures can improve
efficacy cold water exposure used high intensity exercise. directly
pulling conclusions. says not just longer duration,
30, 45 minute 60 minute protocols cold water immersion discussed
earlier, also shorter duration one minute, three minute, five minute exposures
lower temperatures. Temperatures make psychologically want get
soon possibly can, can safely stay done training
really shown improve outcomes terms reducing soreness
improving training efficacy, meaning ability get back training quickly
thereby deliver training stimuli given muscle endurance training
protocol. Translate English, means taking cold shower getting
ice bath form cold water immersion within immediate
minutes even immediate hours following training shown
beneficial. sure number questions instance, long
cold exposure? 11 minute threshold described earlier?
honest you, not enough studies really point critical threshold
eliminating reducing delayed onset muscle soreness getting maximal results
power endurance training, study make couple key points
will just paraphrase. instance, cold water immersion likely
positively influence muscular power performance, reduce muscle soreness, reduce
serum creatine kinase, improve perceived recovery high intensity exercise,
compared passive recovery. can translated cold water exposure
training beneficial probably better passive recovery number
standpoints. addition, say dose response relationships meaning amount
degree cold people exposed often
particular lower temperature cold immersion. sorts cold
immersion protocols one minute two minutes, three minutes, maybe five
minutes, one couldn't stay longer feels stressful one
wants get out. Maybe effective high intensity exercise removal serum
creatine kinase well shorter duration cold water immersion approaches
may effective high intensity endurance performance well.
can translated say unless main goal hypertrophy strength,
cold exposure, ideally cold immersion cold water ice bath, don't
access that, cold showers likely going beneficial done immediately


minutes hours training, especially high intensity training. One
particularly nice thing meta-analysis included studies
involve use cooling packs. again, vests can essentially ice packs
indeed even cryotherapy chambers on. nice table study
want get really detailed go look specifically studies, invite
that. put link study caption episode, all,
study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

01:47:36 Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling

deliberate cold exposure powerful anti-inflammatory tool. Now like
emphasize topic touched beginning episode,
glabrous skin surfaces, hands, upper face, bottoms feet
heat especially good leaving body. another way putting
one can cool body much efficiently glabrous skin surfaces. Now,
want understand science behind various applications,
invite please listen episode Dr. Craig Heller, again,
biology department Stanford. sake episode, just going detail couple


findings laboratory. first one, dealing exercise induced hyperthermia,
think interesting can even save lives understand
way works. particular paper focuses this, will put link
well. title paper novel application chemical cold packs
treatment exercise induced hyperthermia, randomized control trial. pretty
brutal study, brutal subjects is. study involved subjects walk
treadmill pretty significant incline anywhere nine 17% wearing
substantial amount clothing not well ventilated room kept 40
degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. definitely not something
home. study designed induce hyperthermia, mentioned earlier,
can quite dangerous. compared two types cooling. first form
cooling call traditional cooling, ice packs neck, armpits
groin. group, so-called glabrous skin cooling.
palms, soles feet, actually cooling inside
boots inside gloves upper portion face. basic takeaway
study cooling glabrous skin, subjects able sustain
walking inclined treadmills much longer people received
traditional cooling. also return baseline temperature much faster
glabrous skin cooling group. translates real world ever
hyperthermic someone else's hyperthermic, one way cool quickly
cool palmer glabrous, soles feet glabrous upper portion face
glabrous portions body using cool rags, using ice packs using number
different cold objects temperatures. One key thing, going use glabrous skin
cooling, whatever use cool surfaces cannot cold causes
vasoconstriction. mentioned earlier, arterio-venous anastomoses
portals arteries directly veins exist glabrous skin surfaces,
way able cool body essentially pass cool body although
not really doing, actually extracting heat body
technical, extracting heat body, way can
veins don't collapse veins will collapse made very, cold.
want use glabrous skin cooling offset hyperthermia forms
performance, talk moment, need use cool object
surface not cold causes vasoconstriction. can little bit
tough dial in, meaning can tough identify object. reason,


Dr. Heller colleagues developed commercial product called
CoolMitt. can actually go website, coolmitt.com. don't financial
relationship them. know developing technology
period time. involves glove put hand into, circulates water
given temperature so, tempera sure not cause
vasoconstriction palm. may asking, can just put hand
one glove work? Well, powerful glabrous skin
surfaces are. Even just cooling one palm, core body temperature drops radically.
Now commercial technology. know people started
experiment home version this, taking package instance
frozen blueberries cold drink cold metal object, actually bringing
gym run. even people now developing cooled
psych bicycle handles long rides. might seem little kooky crazy you,
soon hear study describe, increases endurance
volume strength training people can conduct appropriately cool
body glabrous skin portals actually quite significant. again,
relates hyperthermia, someone overheating means, try get
heat, get stop exercising, can die hyperthermia, try cool
bottoms feet, palms hands upper portion face.
not mean bad idea put cold water top head.
probably also help perhaps neck. probably not going
good idea standard thing draping someone cold towels
surface body mentioned, beginning episode,

medial preoptic area will typically react increasing core body temperature
further. effects glabrous skin cooling physical performance truly
remarkable provided glabrous skin cooling done correctly. want point
main degree effect volume ability work. want
point think many people, certainly exercise science
community, even general public, hear effects

think, well, not possible. Effects instance, documented
showing doubling tripling number dips one can relatively short
amount time doubling number pullups one can 14% increases
strength even comparable degrees increase weight training output people
performance enhancing drugs, et cetera, et cetera. Part confusion
effects proper palmer cooling, almost always done palmer cooling
less often experiments cooling bottoms feet upper
portion face, effects tend ability work time
just illustrate major effects Heller lab seen
document entered manuscript share moment. typical
protocol people come endurance training running
treadmill condition one group actually palmer cooling
bike treadmill inevitably outcome can
work. can pedal given speed, can run longer given speed
people not palmer cooling receiving cooling way
cold compress back neck ice pack armpits, et cetera.
effects palmer cooling clear robust. context endurance
exercise almost always allow people work, go longer less perceived
effort quit later speak. terms strength training, looked
capacity perform sets dips. one famous examples Dr.
Heller shares episode earlier, can find
hubermanlab.com involves someone coming sets dips, maybe 40 dips.
person actually 40 dips first set, resting period two
three minutes 35 resting period two three minutes,
progressively fewer fewer fewer point period
time, add total number dips can
come back period recovery, not immediately after, take couple
days, come back effectively protocol, rest periods,
two minutes palmer cooling, essentially allows heat move
body, lowering core body temperature words. find
see enormous increases total number dips people can do, doesn't
mean person goes able 40 dips, able 50 dips
60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular

60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli
sort pack described. sets put hands
ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms
hands cool surface minute two minutes sets
returning sets work. Now, heating mechanisms like
wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know
number people who've written saying heard palmer cooling
episode Dr. Heller. tried see quite excellent results.
take discipline. one thing just kind hang gym play
phone sets. another deliberate cooling palms
bottom feet upper portion face. might get weird looks,
course one significantly volume, not experiencing delayed

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

study shows deliberate cold exposure can useful recovery likely
reductions inflammation, muscle connective tissue.
study not look specifically mechanisms reduced inflammation caused
deliberate cold exposure, mechanisms somewhat known. number
studies pointed fact deliberate cold cold generally can reduce
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, interleukin six. can increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin 10 on. Without getting details, think
sufficient say somebody experiences lot delayed onset
muscle soreness, taking cold shower training getting cold
immersion training, even hours later help.
particularly intense training, probably want ratchet number
cold exposure sessions even done separate
days training, lot inflammatory effects training, endurance
strength training actually occurring hours away training stimulus.
not just inflammation goes radically training, often can,
can occur even days even weeks afterwards, depending intense
long duration training is.

60 dips first set, means able 40 first set, 40
second, 38 third forth total duration


workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.
could, instance, fill two bottles cold water, maybe put ice cubes there.
not exact not talking commercial CoolMitt product here,
talking home version use pack frozen blueberries broccoli

ideally put bottoms feet, not always feasible
gyms won't let take off shoes forth, put palms

wearing stocking cap warm environment, might not
potent effect cooling moderate environment,
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. means warm exercise,


lubricate joints, get place not going injure yourself,
whatever form exercise do. like explore palmer cooling, know

02:03:18 Cold Exposure Groin, Increasing Testosterone

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

better endurance strength gains properly. Now final topic
related use deliberate cold exposure improving health performance,
like touch theme exists online, social media, YouTube
various fitness communities using deliberate cold exposure groin, particular
testicles, order try increase testosterone. might sound
really kooky, indeed practice exists. Indeed go onto Amazon,
actually ice pack underwear marketed sake increasing testosterone.
Now, not aware specific well-controlled studies show indeed
works. can imagine based know nervous system, testosterone
cold, et cetera, couple mechanisms one might experience
increases testosterone consequence deliberate cold exposure. First off, let
say no reason apply ice packs way just
described. One course take cold shower. One course use cold
immersion various kinds, still going get exposure groin
testicles cold. Now point people report least anecdotally
increases testosterone consequence practice imagine
measuring serum testosterone, not just guessing
testosterone went up. know study exploring directly, please let know,
put comment section YouTube, even just email me. email
can find it, hubermanlab.com. Please email reference. wasn't able find
reference, can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms deliberate
cold exposure groin, particular testicles, increase testosterone.


first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

02:07:50 Tool: Optimal Timing Daily Cold Exposure

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people

workout extended yet much work, even though takes
time. important point think point perhaps wasn't clear
clearly made previous episodes discuss topic.
interested exploring palmer cooling, first all, recommend taking brief
glance even deep dive study, entitled work volume strength
training responses resistive exercise improve periodic heat extraction
palm. study, describe big increases anaerobic, meaning strength training
output, things like improvement dips, improvement bench press, improvement
pull-ups, et cetera, human subjects. really nice study points
protocols might able adapt setup. instance, six
weeks pull training, palm cooling sets improved volume 144%,
experienced subjects. interesting lot studies
strength training improvements hypertrophy strength done
inexperienced untrained athletes, changes picture somewhat compared
experienced athletes. found strength, meaning one repetition maximum,
increased 22% 10 weeks bench press training. point particularly
strong effects using palmer cooling people reach plateaus endurance
strength training. there, think important point. think going
explore palmer cooling, probably not sort thing going every
run every cycling every strength training session, might
used vastly increase volume vastly increase endurance given
session set sessions order push plateaus. particularly interesting
point light Dr. Heller observed palmer cooling
reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, can eliminate entirely.
interest also points fact reducing core body temperature may
somehow involved short circuiting normal mechanisms delayed onset
muscle soreness. might say, well, temperature involved
delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, want refer back meta-analysis
talked earlier, short duration, cold temperature exposure
training indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness part reduction,
excuse me, creatine kinase. not inconceivable temperature delayed
onset muscle soreness related. raises perhaps important point,
way palmer cooling can improve performance way reducing core
body temperature known one engages exercise


muscular output kind, strength endurance exercise, range temperatures
muscle can perform actually narrow. enzyme called
pyruvate kinase, critical muscle contractions pyruvate kinase can
function narrow range temperatures. temperature gets hot,
meaning muscle heats locally, whether not running cycling swimming
weightlifting, ability muscle continue contract reduced
eventually short circuited completely. think much underexplored
least much discussed aspect so-called muscular failure failure one
continue endure running. instance, run compared bench
press something, don't stop running can't actually contract
muscles further, somehow signals heating muscular tissue
conveyed brain. crosstalk there, probably bidirectional people
stop, quit. quitting reflex. strength training, one can no longer perform
repetition set repetitions part heating muscle locally.
mechanisms well, course, realize that, clear
palmer cooling work simply holding onto cool object, remember not
object cold constricts vessels palms constricts vessels
bottoms feet, holding onto relatively cool object one hands
sets two minutes so, can efficiently reduce core body
temperature so, reduce temperature muscles
work, increase capacity pyruvate kinase continue allow muscles
contract thereby allow volume endurance strength training.
simple protocol Dr. Heller passed find relatively cool object.

first somewhat direct, anytime cool body surface, cold
enough, going get vasoconstriction. subsequently going get
rebound increase vasodilation, meaning going constrict blood vessels
area. cold removed, going blood flow
area. course, blood flow relates organ health tissue health generally.
perfusion region gonads specific additional blood,
imagine ways increasing testosterone, reasonably plausible.
probably likely mechanism relates dopamine increases caused cold
exposure talked earlier. Again, anytime somewhat stressful
stimulus, particular cold exposure, seems catecholamines,
norepinephrine, epinephrine dopamine increase dopamine known
pathway can stimulate testosterone. isn't direct relationship
dopamine stimulating testosterone, interesting pathway way
whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases things like luteinizing hormone,
can trigger increases testosterone well estrogen matter. know
lot people interested use cold exposure
increasing testosterone. people communities indeed using cold
exposure directly gonads, testees order this. not certain
direct contact necessary. cases might actually quite dangerous
least careful terms tissues avoiding damage.
nonetheless, think dopamine impact testosterone likely given
250% increases dopamine observed cold water immersion
points fact cold water immersion likely increases testosterone,
downstream consequence cold water immersion effects dopamine
luteinizing hormone, no reason think increases luteinizing
hormone also increase estrogen. Probably not dangerous levels one
want avoid, don't think anything particularly specific cold
inducing testosterone not hormones. think likely increases
number different hormones. hope will systematic study
not distant future.

also hope not subject cooling gonads experiment. Now promise


last topic last topic, one really important point
think everyone aware going use deliberate cold exposure.
brings us back first thing discussed today, along lines
deliberate cold exposure, baseline temperature going lowest
two hours wake up, going increase morning
wake increase throughout day afternoon, start drop
evening come night head sleep. also want remember
cool external portion body, particular torso, net effect
going increase body temperature. many people, not all,
many people, going deliberate cold exposure, going
increase core body temperature makes sense think
deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism increasing thermogenesis.
means deliberate cold exposure early day,
going get yet increase core body temperature
associated wakefulness, ability alert morning throughout day
on. also means deliberate cold exposure late
evening, night, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM on, going increase
core body temperature recall, decrease core body temperature
one three degrees not just beneficial, necessary order get deep
sleep remain deep sleep. takeaway deliberate cold exposure
done properly will increase core body temperature make feel alert.
early day, probably terrific given us want
alert day. However, late day, evening night, can
disrupt sleep way disrupting core body temperature. Now, caveat
tend deliberate cold exposure early day. Maybe not first thing
morning, mid morning, maybe late three four afternoon
cases. longer days summer, might even later, five 6:00 PM
no trouble sleeping. done deliberate cold exposure late night, 10:00 PM,
11:00 PM part 30 day challenge deliberate cold exposure
every day 30 days got sloppy timing order not miss
day, 11 o'clock night. must say found still fall asleep
easily, even deliberate cold exposure late night. However,
particular days, particularly busy particularly exhausted
arrived deliberate cold exposure no trouble falling asleep


deliberate cold exposure, taking nice warm shower going sleep.
imagine increases core body temperature caused
deliberate cold exposure, one late day, evening night
indeed disrupt sleep. recommendation people
