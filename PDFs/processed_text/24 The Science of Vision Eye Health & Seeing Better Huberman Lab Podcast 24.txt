00:07:24 Senses, Vision, Seeing & See Better

can get protocol there. now going move new topic unrelated
physical performance. Starting episode next four five episodes,
going talk senses. sight, eyesight, hearing, touch, taste,
smell, also going talk critical sense call interoception,
sense internal real estate. Now, reason talking
senses understand senses perceived, about,
underlying cells connections about, will terrific position
understand month's topic follows, mental health. Now, want
emphasize somebody doesn't trouble seeing, hearing,
tasting, smelling excellent sense interoception, believe
episodes will still relevant you, everything
move world, make sense information, organize
thoughts emotions. also want emphasize going cover
lot practical tools. today's episode going vision eyesight,
topic near dear heart, one focusing
well 25 years career. not just going get


mechanistic details light converted electrical potentials things like
that. going talk practical tools can use help
maintain health visual system eyesight. often, young people
will say, do? know, always talking about, know,
neuroplasticity tapers off time, young person, do?
absolutely train support eyesight. fact, young person
see perfectly, feel see world perfectly, best
position bolster, reinforce visual system, don't lose vision
age. addition, can leverage visual system better mental physical
performance, going talk that. somebody suffers
clinical disorder vision, trouble seeing, need corrective lenses
order see, episode definitely you. course can't make clinical
diagnoses, can't one-to-one conversation format,
clinician, scientist, not physician. consult chair ophthalmology,
Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg Stanford University School Medicine, well several
people really vet information make sure protocols describing
consistent clinical literature. severe eye problem,
working really good ophthalmologist and/or optometrist, certainly
ophthalmologist medical doctor. believe information
going discuss today going relevant everybody

00:10:35 Eyes: Really Do, & Work

will set stage month mental health mental performance. So,
get started. hear word vision, often think eyesight,
ability perceive shapes, objects, faces, colors. indeed, vision
involves eyesight, ability see shapes, objects, faces, colors,
forth. However, eyes responsible much that, including mood,
level alertness, included call vision. just want
take three, maybe four minutes, talk visual system works,
built, able so-called see things around you. also want
describe ways eyes visual system impact mood
level alertness. then, going get right protocols,
specific things want enhance vision


maintain vision get older. again, 15-year-old 12-year-old,
episode especially you, nervous system far plastic
mine is. much amenable change, can really build strong visual
system. that, adopt specific behaviors age light viewing
particular times particular ways, can build emotional system
also reinforced visual system. So, talk vision. vision? Well,
vision starts eyes. no called extraocular light perception.
feels good light skin, feels good outside sunlight
people, way light information can get cells body
two little goodies front face. listening,
just pointing eyes. many heard say before,
podcasts, eyes, particular, neural retinas part central
nervous system. part brain. part brain sits
outside cranial vault. words, two pieces brain
deliberately got squeezed skull development placed things
call eye sockets. genetic program specific purpose making sure
three little layers neurons, nerve cells, got squeezed form called
neural retinas. Now, eyes lot goodies
important, goodies going focus lot today.
lens focus light, precisely retina. somebody requires eyeglasses
contacts, chances are, don't correctly, so, use
lenses, like eyeglasses contacts. also pieces eye
designed keep eye lubricated. also things call eyelashes.
people don't know this, eyelashes trigger blink reflex piece
dust something gets front eye. beautiful adaptation nature.
aren't just aesthetically nice. Costello happens long eyelashes. gets
compliments time. Maybe long eyelashes. don't
particularly long eyelashes. eyelashes there, piece dust
something starts head towards cornea, eye blinks very, fast.
fastest reflex eye blink reflex. also things called eyelids.
Now, eyelids might seem like boring topic all, incredibly
fascinating. Today, going talk can actually use visual
system increase levels alertness based neural circuits link
brainstem eyelids. no, not going blinking contest,



00:14:30 Converting Light Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion
Cells

win lose, wouldn't fun you. So, talk
eyes vision. Basically, entire job eyes collect light
information send off rest brain, form brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets past neural retinas. gets
neural retina, specific cells eye called photoreceptors. come
two different types, rods cones. Cones mainly responsible daytime vision,
rods mainly responsible vision night low light conditions,
generally speaking. basically happens eyelids open, light comes
eye, lens focuses light, light also just called photons, light energy,
onto retina. photoreceptors, rods cones, chemical reactions
inside involve things like vitamin chemical reaction converts
light electricity. Now, might seem incredibly abstract, way think
similar to, instance, touch receptors skin
press touch receptors, convert pressure, physical pressure, electrical
information neurons send spinal cord brain, can
register somebody touching top hand, now.
eyes retina, just light gets converted electrical information.
Within eye, within retina, series stages processing,
information eventually gets sent brain specific class neurons.
like know names neurons. called retinal ganglion cells.
thing need know neuroscience eye point
rods cones. cones involved bright daytime vision rods
involved dusk nighttime vision. got cells called retinal
ganglion cells send information off rest brain. Now,
incredible. just want ponder second. still blows mind.
Everything see around you, not actually seeing objects directly.
making best guess based pattern
electricity arrives brain.

00:17:00 Don’t See Anything Directly: Comparison Reflected Light



Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.


eyesight. Now, want talk aspect vision,

transition directly can use light eyesight control stuff
important stuff mood, sleep, appetite.
ways can use protocols will describe, order
preserve even enhance vision, ability see things consciously
perceive them. protocols will describe lot carry
conscious eyesight subconscious aspects vision. just want
understand little bit science seeing, eyesight vision,
protocols will make perfect sense. amazing eyesight is, actually not
evolve us see shapes colors motion form. ancient cells
eyes, reason eyes, communicate information time day
rest brain body. Remember, no extraocular photo reception.
no way light information get cells body, every cell
body needs know night day. talked little bit the,
episodes sleep, episode not sleep. want emphasize
particular category retinal ganglion cell, remember neurons connect
retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present
environment signal brain, therefore, early day late day.
melanopsin ganglion cells sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells
behave like photoreceptors. cells respond to,
care them? Well, care them, regulate

blood sugar levels, dopamine levels, pain threshold.

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look

looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go

trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,

can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A

eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody

00:07:24 Senses, Vision, Seeing & See Better

can get protocol there. now going move new topic unrelated
physical performance. Starting episode next four five episodes,
going talk senses. sight, eyesight, hearing, touch, taste,
smell, also going talk critical sense call interoception,
sense internal real estate. Now, reason talking
senses understand senses perceived, about,
underlying cells connections about, will terrific position
understand month's topic follows, mental health. Now, want
emphasize somebody doesn't trouble seeing, hearing,
tasting, smelling excellent sense interoception, believe
episodes will still relevant you, everything
move world, make sense information, organize
thoughts emotions. also want emphasize going cover
lot practical tools. today's episode going vision eyesight,
topic near dear heart, one focusing
well 25 years career. not just going get


mechanistic details light converted electrical potentials things like
that. going talk practical tools can use help
maintain health visual system eyesight. often, young people
will say, do? know, always talking about, know,
neuroplasticity tapers off time, young person, do?
absolutely train support eyesight. fact, young person
see perfectly, feel see world perfectly, best
position bolster, reinforce visual system, don't lose vision
age. addition, can leverage visual system better mental physical
performance, going talk that. somebody suffers
clinical disorder vision, trouble seeing, need corrective lenses
order see, episode definitely you. course can't make clinical
diagnoses, can't one-to-one conversation format,
clinician, scientist, not physician. consult chair ophthalmology,
Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg Stanford University School Medicine, well several
people really vet information make sure protocols describing
consistent clinical literature. severe eye problem,
working really good ophthalmologist and/or optometrist, certainly
ophthalmologist medical doctor. believe information
going discuss today going relevant everybody

00:10:35 Eyes: Really Do, & Work

will set stage month mental health mental performance. So,
get started. hear word vision, often think eyesight,
ability perceive shapes, objects, faces, colors. indeed, vision
involves eyesight, ability see shapes, objects, faces, colors,
forth. However, eyes responsible much that, including mood,
level alertness, included call vision. just want
take three, maybe four minutes, talk visual system works,
built, able so-called see things around you. also want
describe ways eyes visual system impact mood
level alertness. then, going get right protocols,
specific things want enhance vision


maintain vision get older. again, 15-year-old 12-year-old,
episode especially you, nervous system far plastic
mine is. much amenable change, can really build strong visual
system. that, adopt specific behaviors age light viewing
particular times particular ways, can build emotional system
also reinforced visual system. So, talk vision. vision? Well,
vision starts eyes. no called extraocular light perception.
feels good light skin, feels good outside sunlight
people, way light information can get cells body
two little goodies front face. listening,
just pointing eyes. many heard say before,
podcasts, eyes, particular, neural retinas part central
nervous system. part brain. part brain sits
outside cranial vault. words, two pieces brain
deliberately got squeezed skull development placed things
call eye sockets. genetic program specific purpose making sure
three little layers neurons, nerve cells, got squeezed form called
neural retinas. Now, eyes lot goodies
important, goodies going focus lot today.
lens focus light, precisely retina. somebody requires eyeglasses
contacts, chances are, don't correctly, so, use
lenses, like eyeglasses contacts. also pieces eye
designed keep eye lubricated. also things call eyelashes.
people don't know this, eyelashes trigger blink reflex piece
dust something gets front eye. beautiful adaptation nature.
aren't just aesthetically nice. Costello happens long eyelashes. gets
compliments time. Maybe long eyelashes. don't
particularly long eyelashes. eyelashes there, piece dust
something starts head towards cornea, eye blinks very, fast.
fastest reflex eye blink reflex. also things called eyelids.
Now, eyelids might seem like boring topic all, incredibly
fascinating. Today, going talk can actually use visual
system increase levels alertness based neural circuits link
brainstem eyelids. no, not going blinking contest,



00:14:30 Converting Light Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion
Cells

win lose, wouldn't fun you. So, talk
eyes vision. Basically, entire job eyes collect light
information send off rest brain, form brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets past neural retinas. gets
neural retina, specific cells eye called photoreceptors. come
two different types, rods cones. Cones mainly responsible daytime vision,
rods mainly responsible vision night low light conditions,
generally speaking. basically happens eyelids open, light comes
eye, lens focuses light, light also just called photons, light energy,
onto retina. photoreceptors, rods cones, chemical reactions
inside involve things like vitamin chemical reaction converts
light electricity. Now, might seem incredibly abstract, way think
similar to, instance, touch receptors skin
press touch receptors, convert pressure, physical pressure, electrical
information neurons send spinal cord brain, can
register somebody touching top hand, now.
eyes retina, just light gets converted electrical information.
Within eye, within retina, series stages processing,
information eventually gets sent brain specific class neurons.
like know names neurons. called retinal ganglion cells.
thing need know neuroscience eye point
rods cones. cones involved bright daytime vision rods
involved dusk nighttime vision. got cells called retinal
ganglion cells send information off rest brain. Now,
incredible. just want ponder second. still blows mind.
Everything see around you, not actually seeing objects directly.
making best guess based pattern
electricity arrives brain.

00:17:00 Don’t See Anything Directly: Comparison Reflected Light



Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.


eyesight. Now, want talk aspect vision,

important stuff mood, sleep, appetite.
ways can use protocols will describe, order

no way light information get cells body, every cell
body needs know night day. talked little bit the,
episodes sleep, episode not sleep. want emphasize
particular category retinal ganglion cell, remember neurons connect
retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
shown, excuse me, shown offset

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get
energy nutrients need, healthy cardiovascular system, right,
endurance work, strength training work regularly, going support eyes,

going discuss today going relevant everybody

00:10:35 Eyes: Really Do, & Work

will set stage month mental health mental performance. So,
get started. hear word vision, often think eyesight,
ability perceive shapes, objects, faces, colors. indeed, vision
involves eyesight, ability see shapes, objects, faces, colors,
forth. However, eyes responsible much that, including mood,
level alertness, included call vision. just want
take three, maybe four minutes, talk visual system works,
built, able so-called see things around you. also want
describe ways eyes visual system impact mood
level alertness. then, going get right protocols,
specific things want enhance vision


maintain vision get older. again, 15-year-old 12-year-old,
episode especially you, nervous system far plastic
mine is. much amenable change, can really build strong visual
system. that, adopt specific behaviors age light viewing
particular times particular ways, can build emotional system
also reinforced visual system. So, talk vision. vision? Well,
vision starts eyes. no called extraocular light perception.
feels good light skin, feels good outside sunlight
people, way light information can get cells body
two little goodies front face. listening,
just pointing eyes. many heard say before,
podcasts, eyes, particular, neural retinas part central
nervous system. part brain. part brain sits
outside cranial vault. words, two pieces brain
deliberately got squeezed skull development placed things
call eye sockets. genetic program specific purpose making sure
three little layers neurons, nerve cells, got squeezed form called
neural retinas. Now, eyes lot goodies
important, goodies going focus lot today.
lens focus light, precisely retina. somebody requires eyeglasses
contacts, chances are, don't correctly, so, use
lenses, like eyeglasses contacts. also pieces eye
designed keep eye lubricated. also things call eyelashes.
people don't know this, eyelashes trigger blink reflex piece
dust something gets front eye. beautiful adaptation nature.
aren't just aesthetically nice. Costello happens long eyelashes. gets
compliments time. Maybe long eyelashes. don't
particularly long eyelashes. eyelashes there, piece dust
something starts head towards cornea, eye blinks very, fast.
fastest reflex eye blink reflex. also things called eyelids.
Now, eyelids might seem like boring topic all, incredibly
fascinating. Today, going talk can actually use visual
system increase levels alertness based neural circuits link
brainstem eyelids. no, not going blinking contest,



00:14:30 Converting Light Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion
Cells

win lose, wouldn't fun you. So, talk
eyes vision. Basically, entire job eyes collect light
information send off rest brain, form brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets past neural retinas. gets
neural retina, specific cells eye called photoreceptors. come
two different types, rods cones. Cones mainly responsible daytime vision,
rods mainly responsible vision night low light conditions,
generally speaking. basically happens eyelids open, light comes
eye, lens focuses light, light also just called photons, light energy,
onto retina. photoreceptors, rods cones, chemical reactions
inside involve things like vitamin chemical reaction converts
light electricity. Now, might seem incredibly abstract, way think
similar to, instance, touch receptors skin
press touch receptors, convert pressure, physical pressure, electrical
information neurons send spinal cord brain, can
register somebody touching top hand, now.
eyes retina, just light gets converted electrical information.
Within eye, within retina, series stages processing,
information eventually gets sent brain specific class neurons.
like know names neurons. called retinal ganglion cells.
thing need know neuroscience eye point
rods cones. cones involved bright daytime vision rods
involved dusk nighttime vision. got cells called retinal
ganglion cells send information off rest brain. Now,
incredible. just want ponder second. still blows mind.
Everything see around you, not actually seeing objects directly.
making best guess based pattern
electricity arrives brain.

00:17:00 Don’t See Anything Directly: Comparison Reflected Light



Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.


eyesight. Now, want talk aspect vision,

no way light information get cells body, every cell

episodes sleep, episode not sleep. want emphasize
particular category retinal ganglion cell, remember neurons connect
retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look

looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness

including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses

trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,

can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased

eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg

Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody

maintain vision get older. again, 15-year-old 12-year-old,
episode especially you, nervous system far plastic
mine is. much amenable change, can really build strong visual
system. that, adopt specific behaviors age light viewing
particular times particular ways, can build emotional system
also reinforced visual system. So, talk vision. vision? Well,
vision starts eyes. no called extraocular light perception.
feels good light skin, feels good outside sunlight
people, way light information can get cells body
two little goodies front face. listening,
just pointing eyes. many heard say before,
podcasts, eyes, particular, neural retinas part central
nervous system. part brain. part brain sits
outside cranial vault. words, two pieces brain
deliberately got squeezed skull development placed things
call eye sockets. genetic program specific purpose making sure
three little layers neurons, nerve cells, got squeezed form called
neural retinas. Now, eyes lot goodies
important, goodies going focus lot today.
lens focus light, precisely retina. somebody requires eyeglasses
contacts, chances are, don't correctly, so, use
lenses, like eyeglasses contacts. also pieces eye
designed keep eye lubricated. also things call eyelashes.
people don't know this, eyelashes trigger blink reflex piece
dust something gets front eye. beautiful adaptation nature.
aren't just aesthetically nice. Costello happens long eyelashes. gets
compliments time. Maybe long eyelashes. don't
particularly long eyelashes. eyelashes there, piece dust
something starts head towards cornea, eye blinks very, fast.
fastest reflex eye blink reflex. also things called eyelids.
Now, eyelids might seem like boring topic all, incredibly
fascinating. Today, going talk can actually use visual
system increase levels alertness based neural circuits link
brainstem eyelids. no, not going blinking contest,



00:14:30 Converting Light Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion
Cells

win lose, wouldn't fun you. So, talk
eyes vision. Basically, entire job eyes collect light
information send off rest brain, form brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets past neural retinas. gets
neural retina, specific cells eye called photoreceptors. come
two different types, rods cones. Cones mainly responsible daytime vision,
rods mainly responsible vision night low light conditions,
generally speaking. basically happens eyelids open, light comes
eye, lens focuses light, light also just called photons, light energy,
onto retina. photoreceptors, rods cones, chemical reactions
inside involve things like vitamin chemical reaction converts
light electricity. Now, might seem incredibly abstract, way think
similar to, instance, touch receptors skin
press touch receptors, convert pressure, physical pressure, electrical
information neurons send spinal cord brain, can
register somebody touching top hand, now.
eyes retina, just light gets converted electrical information.
Within eye, within retina, series stages processing,
information eventually gets sent brain specific class neurons.
like know names neurons. called retinal ganglion cells.
thing need know neuroscience eye point
rods cones. cones involved bright daytime vision rods
involved dusk nighttime vision. got cells called retinal
ganglion cells send information off rest brain. Now,
incredible. just want ponder second. still blows mind.
Everything see around you, not actually seeing objects directly.
making best guess based pattern
electricity arrives brain.

00:17:00 Don’t See Anything Directly: Comparison Reflected Light



Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.

no way light information get cells body, every cell

particular category retinal ganglion cell, remember neurons connect
retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol

diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia

emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,

whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals

00:14:30 Converting Light Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion
Cells

win lose, wouldn't fun you. So, talk
eyes vision. Basically, entire job eyes collect light
information send off rest brain, form brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets past neural retinas. gets
neural retina, specific cells eye called photoreceptors. come
two different types, rods cones. Cones mainly responsible daytime vision,
rods mainly responsible vision night low light conditions,
generally speaking. basically happens eyelids open, light comes
eye, lens focuses light, light also just called photons, light energy,
onto retina. photoreceptors, rods cones, chemical reactions
inside involve things like vitamin chemical reaction converts
light electricity. Now, might seem incredibly abstract, way think
similar to, instance, touch receptors skin
press touch receptors, convert pressure, physical pressure, electrical
information neurons send spinal cord brain, can
register somebody touching top hand, now.
eyes retina, just light gets converted electrical information.
Within eye, within retina, series stages processing,
information eventually gets sent brain specific class neurons.
like know names neurons. called retinal ganglion cells.
thing need know neuroscience eye point
rods cones. cones involved bright daytime vision rods
involved dusk nighttime vision. got cells called retinal
ganglion cells send information off rest brain. Now,
incredible. just want ponder second. still blows mind.
Everything see around you, not actually seeing objects directly.
making best guess based pattern
electricity arrives brain.

00:17:00 Don’t See Anything Directly: Comparison Reflected Light



Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.

retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

Now, might just seem totally wild hard wrap head around, think
way, way actually works. take example
color, like green blue. cones eye respond best
wavelength light reflected off, say, green apple. So, don't actually see
green apple. see light bouncing off green apple, goes
eye, see perceive round green, not see
anything green. No green light arrives brain. happens brain actually
compares amount green reflection coming off apple amount red
blue around it. Well, might say, well, green apple sitting brown table
white surface. Well, then, will appear green. amount wavelength
light green high, amount red low, so, looks
green, okay? So, don't actually see anything directly. brain receiving
series signals, electrical signals, comparing electrical signals, order come
call perceptions. Like see something green, green apple,
see red. Let give slightly different example. play key
piano, say play, not musician, going to, hopefully won't get
incorrectly say like E sharp, maybe like ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding. brain gets signal, doesn't actually know E what, doesn't
recognize play another key next it, dun, dun, dun, dun,
does, math, subtraction, compares two.
see something green, see something red, see something blue, not
actually seeing directly. brain making guess green red blue
thing comparing around it, okay? seems hard wrap
head around, don't worry, will explain depth going forward.
really want people understand this, vision, eyesight, not looking things
directly, information getting directly brain, translated. Light
information transformed electrical signals visual system exquisitely
understands. Now, mean?

00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View
World)

care this? Well, dog like do, cat, not


colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving

way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses

yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less

expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual

lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look

eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release

reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye

actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up
studies well University Pennsylvania universities. everything
talked today relates studies done published quality, peer-

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get
energy nutrients need, healthy cardiovascular system, right,
endurance work, strength training work regularly, going support eyes,

colorblind, lack cones respond red, meaning long wavelength light.
mean? means see green, different
green see. Not apple invisible them, aren't able
compare red, are. consequence, look green lawn,
looks brownish orange them. wear red shirt front dog
cat, see stop sign see stop sign, see orangish-brown,
see red. presuming trichromat, meaning three-color vision. So,
say every animal sees world differently, depending whether
not one two three different cones, red, blue, green cones.
mantis shrimp things, see hundreds colors human beings
can't see, okay? Many things animals see visual ranges can't see in.
instance, pit viper senses heat emissions, literally sees heat coming off
animal want eat. ground squirrel, can see
ultraviolet light. going sound kind weird, ground squirrels actually signal
one another standing outside shining sunlight off other's stomachs
other, signaling distance, just like, know, signal somebody
mirror sunlight distance. species primates, isn't pleasant
think about, urinate hands, wipe stomach.
use sunlight reflect different signals other. don't know
saying. always assume something cute nice, maybe insulting
other. actually gets right heart bigger questions, like
consciousness, see? there? much life really accessible
us? go on, know, used kind obsession mine
coming field visual neuroscience understand different
animals see world compared us. know, give one example, diving
bird, know, bird flies ocean. incredible task.
view horizon, view schools fish, then, make trajectory
water grab one fish eat. water called
refractory index. actually shifts like prism, impression perception
fish is, right? bird sees fish right it, know, adjust
diving trajectory just right, knows fish actually isn't sees it.
probably inches ahead side that, way water
diverts image. ever dropped coin bottom pool, go straight
looking location. look top pool, dive


straight eyes closed, will miss, water refracts, shifts
visual image. Well, diving birds arrangement retinal cells
communicate brain streak view horizon, 'cause need
know relative horizon, pupil like
bottom eye, can make accurate dive attacks
schools fish, catch fish, eat fish. just pupils middle
eyes. ton optics eye, way communicates
brain allows us see. spend hours talking this,
like embed mind experience outside world
bottlenecked, limited wavelengths, colors will, light
can see. brain coming best guess there. doesn't
actually know there. vision distinctly different say, vision
dog vision somebody dichromat, meaning don't
red cone. lot people, particular 1 80 males, lacks red cone
therefore, sees world much way Costello does. Although, sees
just much lower toward ground. So, like understand
way eye communicates brain.

00:24:05 Everything See Best Guess, Blind Spots

also like understand brain making guesses
guesses largely right. know that? Well, right
reach grab glass, time grab glass, don't miss,
right? time, make judgments world around you, based
visual impression them, allows move functionally world.
let give examples guessing happening right now.
incredible that, day, still blows mind. Cover one eye one hand.
driving, maybe don't this. viewing world around you, presumably
can see everything there. one eye eye.
probably see better one other, talk that.
giant blind spot middle visual field. called blind spot. spot
connections, wires, retinal ganglion cells exit back
eye head off toward brain. words, blind huge spot
central vision. part vision highest acuity, highest detail, yet,


don't see ever. cover one eye, see perfectly fine. not just
eye moving around really quickly. brain guessing
spot, absolutely incredible, so, don't see blind spot.
happening time. Now, two eyes open, way eyes
positioned head way view world fill
other's blind spots, pretty convenient. cover one eye, impossible,
yet, still see world complete.

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little
house. prior knowledge things away smaller.
main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,
look you, image face, light bouncing off face
precise, lands one eye slightly different location eye,
brain math. basically equivalent geometry trigonometry,
essentially figures far away me, just incredible.
brain very, fast, brain uses 40 50% total real
estate vision. important vision is. Now, blind,
low vision, no vision, real estate brain will taken neurons
control sense touch sense hearing, your, indeed, hearing touch
much better, higher acuity, faster blind people. you,
presume sighted, works. So, kind vision eye brain
nutshell. bunch different stations brain different things.


eyesight. Now, want talk aspect vision,

stuff don't perceive, subconscious stuff. then,
transition directly can use light eyesight control stuff
important stuff mood, sleep, appetite.
ways can use protocols will describe, order
preserve even enhance vision, ability see things consciously
perceive them. protocols will describe lot carry
conscious eyesight subconscious aspects vision. just want
understand little bit science seeing, eyesight vision,
protocols will make perfect sense. amazing eyesight is, actually not
evolve us see shapes colors motion form. ancient cells
eyes, reason eyes, communicate information time day
rest brain body. Remember, no extraocular photo reception.
no way light information get cells body, every cell
body needs know night day. talked little bit the,
episodes sleep, episode not sleep. want emphasize
particular category retinal ganglion cell, remember neurons connect
retina brain, involved special kind vision nothing
conscious perception around you, happening right now,
happening time. so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells, named
opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes
amphibians change skin color different light conditions. have, believe
not, little bit frog skin eye, speak. Okay, not exactly,
essentially equivalent frogs skin eye.
low vision no vision, long retinas, likely still
cells, even though can't see don't see well. cells, retinal ganglion cells,


communicate areas brain particular qualities light present
environment signal brain, therefore, early day late day.
melanopsin ganglion cells sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells
behave like photoreceptors. cells respond to,
care them? Well, care them, regulate
get sleepy, feel awake, fast metabolism is, excuse me,
blood sugar levels, dopamine levels, pain threshold.
factors impact things, one the, not powerful
determinant, things like mood pain threshold, sleepiness,
wakefulness, et cetera. melanopsin ganglion cells shown Nitz

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input

occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create

eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard

minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up

00:25:50 Depth Perception

brain incredible things. also creating depth, sense depth.
Even though arrives retina essentially readout two-dimensional,
flat image, can sense depth. know depth? Well, simple.
Things closer tend larger things far away. Things
closer tend look like moving faster. ever train
look side, rungs fence, train tracks going you, look like
going fast. look off distance, look like moving
slowly. differences close away.
So, little house horizon, don't look say, oh, must tiny, little

main way that. compare location, information
light lands two eyes. eyes slightly offset one another. that,
instance, look you, standing right front right now,

opsin contain within them. essentially photoreceptors,
remember said photoreceptors ganglion cells? Well,
melanopsin cells, name suggests, melanopsin,
photoreceptor built inside them. opsin contain actually similar
melanopsin present skin amphibians causes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,

philosophical, not. don't know time real thing watches
clocks. know time biological level, based sun where,
course relative sun, earth spinning

episode depth. blue light contrast blue yellow, remember


don't see blue, subconscious. blue reflections coming off sunlight.
Blue light, told terrible us, absolutely essential wonderful
waking brain, triggering sorts positive biological reactions, needs
viewed early day. can't see sunlight, thick cloud cover
say a, know, UK winter, artificial lights, especially blue
lights, beneficial you. need lot light contrast
yellow, order trigger melanopsin cells, will trigger circadian
clock, sits roof mouth, will signal every cell body,
including temperature, rhythms, et cetera. first things first, visual system not
seeing faces, motion, et cetera. ancient cells eye,
right now speak, inform body brain time day,
want get bright light early day. Absolutely essential, two 10 minutes,
can download light meter app want measure lux. we,
explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front

using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory

office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care

can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A

eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.

alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
shown, excuse me, shown offset

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,

explained earlier episodes

00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours
Per Day

got little convoluted, get two 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now,
another reason this, never spoken
podcast, several studies now thousands subjects,
exploring can done prevent myopia, nearsightedness, visual
defects. turns out, series large clinical trials, conclusion emerged
getting two hours day outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, blue light
everyone demonized, getting sunlight day two hours, even
reading things, things outside, significant effect
reducing probability will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether not
also due fact myopia can caused viewing things close
much. indoors, tend looking things closely, right? Unless
large house walls far away you, effect
seem directly related getting sunlight, not just distance
viewing. going describe study just briefly, second protocol.
one protocol getting sunlight set circadian clocks, meaning
wake up, establish sleep, will occur 12 16 hours later,


sleep episode. also enhance mood, enhance metabolism, optimize
hormone levels, optimize learning dopamine levels, feel good
neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,

trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,

can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A

eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might

neuromodulator essential not getting depressed, et cetera. now's
second protocol, ideally, includes children, long not
small infants, ideally, getting two hours outdoor time, even cloud
cover. Remember, evolved mostly outdoor conditions, not indoor conditions,
no artificial blue light will not replace aspect visual system offsetting
myopia. just want briefly describe study, important one,
don't think discussed often enough. many studies exploring this,
one ones liked most, looked 693 students, subset
encouraged spend 11 hours week outdoors. Okay, kids school five
days week so, spending 11 hours week outdoors. sometimes
reading outdoors. not always just playing outdoors, might reading books,
et cetera. used eight different schools. reason study,
probably mentioned, myopia, nearsightedness, global epidemic.
least, referred study. don't know decides
epidemic not. think thresholds that. paper published journal
Ophthalmology 2018 described fact outdoors two hours day
significantly reduce probability children develop nearsightedness.
turns based studies, adults spend two hours day outside,
reading outside, talking outside. No, not include light coming
windshield car, explain moments, offset formation
myopia. Now, myopia, nearsightedness, way lens
focuses light onto retina. don't want get long description now,
basically lens bring light retina, not front it, not behind it. brings
light position front retina, won't see clearly, will need
corrective lenses. brings light directly retina, will see clearly,
intuitive makes, makes sense. might say, well,
outside, getting blue light blue-yellow contrast sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, probably, want emphasize probably
fact melanopsin ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells, not just responsible sleep, talking circadian clock,
sort thing, also make connections within retina. connect things
like, aficionados, ciliary body, iris, muscles structures


within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus

classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses

trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care

can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A

eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get
energy nutrients need, healthy cardiovascular system, right,
endurance work, strength training work regularly, going support eyes,
brain, vision. indirect, essential, right? necessary,
not going sufficient. going things support
eyesight, well. healthy cardiovascular system, going
deliver blood oxygen nutrients incredible apparati front
face, two pieces brain, going support overall brain health vision

within eye actually move lens allow adjust vision things
close far away. so, increase improve health little tiny
muscles within eye move lens. probably, again, needs little
bit work, order really tamp mechanism. probably also
involved bringing growth factors blood supply muscles neurons
responsible focusing mechanism within eye. remember, eye
optical device. born lenses, don't use glasses, maybe
lenses eyes lenses need move. not
rigid lens, like glass lens. dynamic lens, little muscles pull it,
squeeze it, make thicker thinner, look things close far away,
describe works moment. melanopsin cells
activation sunlight, completely subconsciously, unaware, unaware this,
promote health system within eye allow offset myopia,
nearsightedness. words, getting outside two hours day, day,
average, even cloud cover, without sunglasses on, will allow offset
formation myopia. Now, might still form myopia certain structural
features genetic basis that, will talk things can well.
everybody, this. might seem like lot, way
visual system works. Staying indoors, just getting artificial light, looking
things close leads visual defects. Okay, form kind like visual obesity,
right? posture visual system, will, going unhealthy just
indoors not getting sunlight early day least two hours per
day. want talk little bit eyes adjust things close
us far away. absolutely brilliant consequence nature design.
whenever say nature design, people always ask me, know,
really trying say? trying talk creators? talking
intelligent design? Look, want frank you. wasn't consulted design
phase,

00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Pupils & Bendy
Lens

neither you. so, interesting, not topic
discussion. clear topic discussion eye can


dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative

open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard

minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up

dynamically adjust light lands moving lens changing shape
lens eye, process called accommodation. understand
process accommodation, not can enhance health eyes
immediate long-term, also can work better. able focus better
physical mental work. will able concentrate longer. want
emphasize much mental focus, whether not cognitive endeavors
physical endeavors, grounded place visual focus, okay?
look ability hold concentration critically determining
think. So, words, can hold visual focus, can hold mental focus,
cognitive focus, holding visual focus challenging, tiring, requires
movement lens. movement lens requires activation muscles.
activation muscles, know physical performance episodes,
saw even don't, dictated neurons. So, accommodation?
Well, actually simple elegant. again, another case
whenever look stuff, even though looking years, learning
years, still boggles mind apparati built eyes. So,
lenses eyes, things called irises. know,
familiar iris, see people's pupils get bigger smaller,
intuitively think eyes pupils. actually draw two circles sheet
paper, just, look like two circles. put little dots middle
them, look like eyes. brain recognizes eyes, one first
things see come world eyes. actually, put little
dots close together, it'll look kind wrong, like cross-eyed. put
different locations within two dots, opposing locations, it'll look google-eyed.
so, brain actually filling face information, even emotional
information, just based recognition eyes. so, clearly know this,
real estate deep in, know, brain, responsible
analyzing recognizing faces eyes position little things
call irises, pupils, et cetera, really important interpret status
others. powerful thing just put two circles and, know,
move pupils around paper. fact, want get accommodation,
think it, one pupils one there, one
really big, one really small, actually sign pretty severe
damage. someone gets hit hard side head, notice shine


light one eye. know that? actually looking
eye. shine light eye pupil constricts limit amount light
comes in, doesn't damage eye. also happens walk outside,
bright, constricts, called consensual pupil reflex.
connection deep brainstem, deep back brain near neck,
connects pupil mechanism two eyes, looking eye.
shine light one eye, people constricts one doesn't,
good chance brainstem damage. side a,
know, football field boxing match, someone unfortunately hits head. So,
two pupils don't freak one pupil little bit smaller other, doesn't
necessarily mean brain damage. suddenly one pupil bigger
other, absolutely want go see neurologist right away. So, eyes
pupils indicative things happening deep brain. Now,
accommodation ability accommodate things close
away. way works iris, musculature, structure called
ciliary body move lens. So, look far away, okay, see things
far away, lens actually relaxes, can flatten out. want think this.
look far away, may anywhere like 20 feet away
horizon miles kilometers away you, lens can just relax. can
flatten out. notice actually relaxing look horizon. relaxing
look far away. Whereas look something close like pen, phone,
computer screen, microphone, takes effort. sense effort. Now,
effort actually eye movements, muscles can move
eyes within sockets. lot work, quote unquote, neural work
muscles move contract, lens actually gets thicker, order
bring light retina not location front behind it, called
accommodation. also changes size pupil, things closer
away you. fact, simple way think this. Healthy pupils
going dilate look something far away you. Now, see
something excites stresses out, pupils also get big. eyes get
wide. look something far away, pupils going dilate.
look things closer you, move close, pupils
going shrink. part accommodation mechanism. Now, might say,
telling accommodation? crazy. telling


this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want

Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young

occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating

that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant

good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses

see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation

also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb

probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et

emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing

close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get
energy nutrients need, healthy cardiovascular system, right,
endurance work, strength training work regularly, going support eyes,

this? Well, days spending lot time looking things, mainly
phones close, computers close, indoors. young
person, even 25 older, spending lot time looking
things close, not allowing vision relax. words, not
giving lens opportunity flatten out, muscles relieve
work, may may not migraine headaches. may
may not headaches. might, cause those.
also training eyes good looking things close not far away,
consequence, reshaping neural circuitry brain, not good.
not healthy look things close. Now, lot recommendations
right now,

00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing 20min Every 90 Minutes “Close
Viewing”

especially lockdowns last, know, 12 18 months people
look Zoom every while. maybe now, hearing people
take calls instead Zoom, look computer
screen. actually not going solve problem, just look computer
screen. need go window. need look distance. Ideally,
even open window, windows actually filter lot blue
light want daytime. lot sunlight, actually 50 times less
gets through. want get onto balcony. want relax eyes look
horizon. want go called panoramic vision, let vision
expand. want lens mechanism elastic. don't want get stuck
configuration looking things close. Accommodation wonderful feature
visual system, don't want push hard, often, long.
want view horizon. want get outside, not just lighten load
mind, think things, maintain health visual
system. words, want exercise muscles involves
lens moving getting kind thicker relaxing lens. relaxation
lens actually one best things can musculature inner eye.
protocol, often this? might surprised,
every 30 minutes focused work, probably want look every


just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses

that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,

course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,

just try relax face eye muscles, including jaw muscles,
things closely linked brainstem allow eyes go so-
called panoramic vision, just not really focusing anything
refocus work. least every 90 minutes looking things close, even
looking screen, know, television screen, watching movie,
indoors, every 90 minutes that, ideally least 20, probably
like 30 minutes outside, ideally. can't outside, non up-
close vision. might say, impossible, supposed that?
know, office building. Get window, get outside can
safely, get onto balcony, just let eyes relax. Many people experiencing
severe vision problems, not getting enough sunlight day.
sleep problems, not viewing sunlight early day.
mentioned previous episodes, getting lot artificial stimulation, artificial
light stimulation, eye middle night, visual
system. migraines, fatigue, challenges eyesight getting worse age,
even young people, a, know, least according articles,
describe epidemic myopia can largely dealt getting outside, going
panoramic vision, experiencing distanced vision, look things off
horizon. walking hiking biking, not looking phone whole time
that. bus stop commuting, certainly not looking
phone entire time that. vital. want emphasize
another protocol, though don't want get much depth,

00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Space Daily

'cause want make sure also talk number important aspects
visual system related sight, getting optic flow
important de-stressing system. move space, whether not
walking, biking, even swimming, self-generated optic flow, probably
not driving motorcycling, yes, bicycling don't know, unicycling. don't know
thought unicycling. used graduate student Stanford
really impressive unicycler, pretty rare. long self-generated
optic flow, meaning generating motion body visual images around
passing eyes, good visual system.


good mood systems neuromodulator systems brain body
regulate mood. well-established. not telling people get away
phone computers. spend lot time staring page, drawing, writing,
texting, et cetera, just like do, really talking simple
protocols aren't just designed improve sleep, really designed
bolster enhance vision. course, podcast, will also
talk things can take improve vision. visual behavior isn't
right, believe always start behaviors, think
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, behaviors around vision aren't right,
cannot expect good, healthy eyesight long time, meaning throughout
lifespan. vision already poor, many things talking
today, perhaps them, will improve vision degree. vision
starting go, behaviors likely really enhance quality
vision will build maintain time. essentially zero
cost, okay? live dark environment, like cave outer space, going
hard stuff. planet earth, even cloud cover,

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up
studies well University Pennsylvania universities. everything
talked today relates studies done published quality, peer-

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual

00:54:26 Protocol 5: Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Versus


chances can some, most, even some, most, days.
describe next going seem silly face it, deep
mechanism support it. Put simply, get tired, eyelids close,
alert, eyelids open. neurons brain,
depending level alertness, will make easy hard keep eyes open.
Now, complete duh, except don't often think relationship
alertness looking eyelids. Now, learned
colleague mine psychiatry, happens work hypnosis. not going
hypnotize right now. actually future episode. happens
get tired? eyelids close, chin moves down. tend nod way.
ever classroom, certainly not one mine,
classroom lecturer kind drawing on, afternoon, notice
number students, heads jolt, kind eyelids closing,
chin dropping, they, see bunch heads bouncing back up, right?


definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual

definitely one people class. post-lunch afternoon,
warm, hum air conditioner, whatever is, just out, okay?
wide awake, opposite happens. eyelids open way, chin
happens up. no, not telling good posture. However,
learned colleague Stanford circuits actually act loops.
look up, maybe melanopsin cells bottom
retina, are, maybe order view sunlight,
overhead, is, system alertness linked position eyes.
look eyelids up, actually purpose. actually creates
wakefulness signal brain. so, might seem like silliest
simple tool might ever describe podcast, feeling tired, actually
can beneficial wakefulness systems brain, including locus coeruleus
areas release norepinephrine actually look up, actually look
toward ceiling. don't want chin way back, look raise
eyes toward ceiling look try hold 10 15 seconds.
isn't looking closing eyes, like nice sunny day, relaxing.
looking actually looking ceiling. actually triggers
areas brain involved wakefulness. somebody falling
asleep work, can beneficial. Likewise, many people looking
phone day, chin down, sitting computer
positioned them, trouble staying awake focusing. can
very, tell Costello time, 'cause always falling asleep trying
work, positioning computer screen eye level, sometimes
actually eye level, can actually create wakefulness alertness work
going do. simply connection brainstem
circuits neural circuits control wakefulness eyelids opening
looking up. Okay, it, again, remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,
grounded hardwired, meaning present birth, aspects
neural circuitry. norepinephrine released locus coeruleus isn't just mouthful,
really interesting powerful mechanism rest brain wakes up.
Locus coeruleus hoses rest brain norepinephrine, order wake
circuits work attention. so, eyes actually way, route
increased alertness. Eyes route sleepiness, reduced alertness.
one friend texts here, like street holds phone here.


looks ridiculous. yet, know, trying create sense alertness,
goal, positioning computer screens high, chin up, looking need
kind create alertness signal, not always chin texting, working
typewriters, reading us. actually going send recurring wakefulness
signal. things up, tend alert. everything's focused down,
including eyes, tends suppressive sedative type signaling

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get
emotionally comfortable

01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,

first. Now, talk pattern vision, actual seeing things, like faces
colors, et cetera. presuming colorblind. can
help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep Dark Room Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)

deeper centers brain. Now, move science, tools,
protocols related pattern vision, want mention another study done
University Pennsylvania. terrific group works sleep.
made important discovery think everybody know about,
children sleep rooms nightlight dim lights much likely
develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely, children sleep dark rooms,
either dim nightlights complete black, much lower, statistically
speaking, significantly lower probability developing myopia, nearsightedness. Now,
that? wavelengths light matter melanopsin cells,
oftentimes can get eyelids. particularly true children
people thin eyelids. people, like me, thin eyelids.
told before. Not many people touch eyelids, among have,
thin eyelids. notice thin eyelids compared say, Costello. Now,
Costello's eyes droop. can't even close eyes way droopy.
many people thin eyelids, people going even prone
light coming eyelid. parents, kids, adults, really want
try get place can sleep completely black dark environment.
One little exposure light, no big deal. ties back protocol
described mood sleep episodes, viewing light, even
low intensity hours 10:00 PM 4:00 extremely detrimental
dopamine mood producing systems brain. can negatively
impact learning, immunity, even blood sugar, make people type two
diabetes prone way communication melanopsin cells structure
brain called habenula. throwing verbiage? Well,
people asked mechanisms. So, really want know, look


blue light blue light getting eyelids middle night,
likely distorting lens accommodation mechanism eye leading myopia
cases. So, one reason avoid blue light exposure bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure, middle night. Viewing light bright intensity
hours 10:00 PM 4:00 consistent basis going suppress
dopamine, way light activates melanopsin cells,
habenula, dopamine system. simple, get much bright light
can safely, right? never want look light bright painful look at,
daytime. Try go without sunglasses, unless need them. Now, wear
sunglasses sake sport sake really bright out, try get two
hours day working outside outside, even cloud cover, going
offset myopia. going help get better sleep. going support mood
metabolism, et cetera. night, sleeping lot lights room,
especially, kids need nightlight, try wean off
nightlight, going beneficial vision wean off
nightlight put darker environment. Obviously, want get

help red-green colorblind folks not using red slides diagrams,
menus, things sort. Try use magenta instead. can see
contrast magenta green better red green. So, kind
colorblind folks there. actually fair percentage. lot
different kinds colorblind. just mention people true monochromats.
see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

see world black white. exceedingly rare. colorblind people,
colorblind quotes, red-green colorblind, meaning lack red cone photo
pigment, meaning can't see long wavelengths light. see world much
canine cat does, don't get green-red contrast.
call red-green colorblind. green cones, can't contrast
comparison described beginning episode. use magenta,
will able see things. wonder stop signs stop lights things aren't


magenta. Well, world unkind red-green color blind individuals,
learn position lights street lights. learn
shapes signs, can readily, usually says stop well.
care colorblind folks, do, service by,
think law actually U.S.,

01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Vision Sharp Distance Viewing Every Day

menus required colorblind accessible. can improve vision?
can get better seeing things? Well, one way make sure spend
least 10 minutes day total, least, viewing things off distance.
well half mile more, try see horizon, try get vision
location beyond four walls house apartment, doors car,
windshield car. know can hard do, valuable.
live city like New York skyscrapers everywhere, probably
experienced incredible sense relaxation, aesthetically beautiful,
walking one long avenues, turn, think name
New York, sunset suddenly visible along long avenue
skyscrapers. just relaxing able, suddenly, see distance,
actually eye mechanism relaxing lens relaxing
musculature around eyes sends signals deep brainstem release
centers involved alertness, AKA stress. pleasant
reason. not a, not placebo effect will. bunch
neurochemicals things associated that. try see distance,
good eyesight. It'll keep lens nice elastic, muscles
nice strong move lens,

01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit

relaxing component it. Now, visual system exquisitely tuned
motion, not just self-generated motion, motion things around us. one
things something called smooth pursuit. Smooth pursuit ability
track individual objects moving, name suggests, smoothly space
various trajectories. can actually train improve vision looking smooth


pursuit stimuli, sounds really boring. can is, provide link
think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,

think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things

think pretty good used various clinics, ophthalmology
optometry clinics. can actually take minutes day, maybe don't
day, every third day so, actually just visually track ball.
Sometimes moving kind infinity symbol. Sometimes
sawtooth. Sometimes changing speed. Sometimes cue following,
little target, dilating contracting. going keep muscles, want
clear, going keep extraocular muscles conditioned strong allow
healthy smooth pursuit system. Remember, brain follows eye. follows
movements eye. deal that. neural circuits within brain
cope changes smooth pursuit. lot reading close,
not viewing horizons, not getting lot smooth pursuit type stimulation
life, just getting within confines little box phone, like
smooth pursuit over, know, millimeters always talk terms
visual angle, amount degrees visual angle. just looking
smooth pursuit little tiny box phone, computer screen,
not looking objects environment like swooping birds things like that,
guessing many not spending time doing, well,
mechanisms smooth pursuit will get worse time. vision will get worse.
so, prefer people get real world experience smooth pursuit
tracking visual objects, don't know, maybe good reason go hockey game
or, know, try keep eye puck, can never seem do.
moves fast. guess good reason watch live sports thing,
watch tennis match, like cat, like kitten, watching ball go back forth,
whatever, watching kids play, doesn't really matter. idea want use
visual system regularly designed for, smooth pursuit great
way keep visual motion tracking systems brain eye
extraocular muscles working really nice coordinate fashion. say five 10
minutes,

01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times Week

three times week will great. care vision, can train vision
way. one train accommodation. lot videos there,


want clear, internet, clinicians,
not. scientists, sources, talking
things can make vision better, improve vision.
geared toward improving extraocular eye muscles, consult chair
ophthalmology Stanford School Medicine, Jeff Goldberg, MD
PhD, phenomenal scientist, phenomenal clinician, incidentally,
phenomenal chairman well, sorts things, tools, actually beneficial
pattern vision sight, just much internet. Not
accurate good, frankly. agreed smooth pursuit stimulus,
kind training, well as, exercise, well near far. spending
minutes, might even just two minutes looking something close,
going activate accommodation mechanisms, moving arms
length, focusing five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 20 seconds,
slowly moving location, out. actually lot like visual
training done post-concussion try repair, actually repair
balance, motor, visual, cognitive aspects brain. going
guest future time that, deal concussion post-concussion
training. lot post concussion recovery training centers around visual system.
Not just people trying recover vision sense balance,
because, mentioned earlier, brain's ability make sense environment,
brain's ability parse time, not just day-night schedule, also shorter time
intervals, follows visual system. Something turn little bit end.
mean? tool is, spend two three minutes smooth pursuit.
programs YouTube, can just look smooth pursuit stimulus,
provide link couple like well. pen
wanted. this. Someone else hold wand, that,
got someone can you. Practice accommodation minutes,
maybe every day, just bringing something close. feel strain
eyes that. can feel right now, move out. feel relaxation point. Move
past relaxation point, will called vergence eye
movement maintain focus location moves out, bring back in. point
actually go cross-eyed, will differ different people, depending
far apart eyes are, called interpupillary distance. me,
teased before, short interpupillary distance. not cyclops,


heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can

highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard

think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things

familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
shown, excuse me, shown offset

know, drawbacks? Well, can go ever favorite examine.com.
do? Well, number different effects, huge number fact,
seem notably increase, now shown three studies, antioxidant enzyme
profile. number different effects, notable sake episode,
one ocular blood flow. seem increase amount ocular blood
flow, blood supply eyes, makes interesting compound.
number effects. whatever reason, also notable effect, several
studies shown this, fertility males. seems least double

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up
studies well University Pennsylvania universities. everything
talked today relates studies done published quality, peer-
reviewed journals.

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,
buffet will, things try enhance support vision.
Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get
energy nutrients need, healthy cardiovascular system, right,
endurance work, strength training work regularly, going support eyes,
brain, vision. indirect, essential, right? necessary,
not going sufficient. going things support
eyesight, well. healthy cardiovascular system, going
deliver blood oxygen nutrients incredible apparati front

heading there. people walleyed, like flounder. Well, depending
interpupillary distance, point things get blurry cross-eyed will vary.
me, know, get about, oh gosh, guess six inches nose.
really hard, can't accommodate longer. move another inch, everything's
nice focus. Try see whether not can get things closer. Now, don't want
get cross-eyed. Remember parents told you, parents told me,
cross eyes, young, can stay way. Actually,
won't necessarily stay way, brain can start losing information ability
see binocular depth, something talk moment. now, protocol
be, know, two three, maybe five minutes, just practice that, practice
accommodation, sure give eyes rest, get outside, look
horizon, nothing, just kind let eyes go soft. guess yogis
call soft gaze. Just kind relax eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try see walls around without moving head. Exercise
eye muscles, exercise accommodation mechanisms eyes, practice
little bit smooth pursuit. don't neurotic this,
often enough, meaning every day, every third day so, can strange
person plane classroom this. know, people might chuckle
look funny, tease you, okay, able see
losing vision, get last laugh. Please don't laugh them,
maybe can help them. point, can hold pen them. worth doing.
really worth preserving vision. again, young person, great,
can actually build extra strong visual system,

01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol Improve Photoreceptors & Vision

using tools describing. want talk new set findings
related red light offsetting age-related macular degeneration. lot
ways visual system gets worse time, one called age-related
macular degeneration. Glen Jeffrey University College London, somebody
known decades a, scientist, done beautiful work
development function visual system, published number papers
recently, one got particularly high amount attention press one
showed flashing red light eyes early day, not late day, early


day, can help offset age-related macular degeneration, presumably
enhancing mitochondrial function photoreceptors. seem
evidence that. Although, still early days, want emphasize don't want
shine really bright lights eyes. never want look light
bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve
function mitochondria. photoreceptors lot mitochondria,
energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off
activity. actually whether not see something front you, like pen
face, way photoreceptors turning off not turning on. really
cool twist, don't want go far rabbit hole, check
interested photoreceptors work. absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look web. not partial just Google. happen
use Google, use web browser look photoreceptors hyperpolarization site.
can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual
system well, people just office work. Although, lot office
work, chances not getting lot long-view vision. accommodation
mechanisms going start suffer time. think can reliably predict that.
tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get

bright painful, never want force eyelids stay open. need
close eyes order comfortable, well, chances light
bright. just couple minutes day, like two minutes day flashing red
light one eye, other. long early day noon
time, long individuals 40 years older, seem
significant effect offsetting age-related macular degeneration
otherwise occur. Again, early findings. want this, please careful.
Please talk optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. eyesight precious.
don't want damage it, interesting. seem like red light can improve

energy-producing organelles within cells,
metabolically active cells entire body. photoreceptors active time
looking around, even eyes closed, active. fact,
weird twist biology, please look really interested
this, photoreceptors actually active dark. weird. twist
biology, way system's arranged, light comes on, shut off

can learn lot that, real nerd stuff, like am.

01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11

Okay, red light eye, can perhaps, seems, help maintain vision, smooth
pursuit exercises, accommodation near-far exercises. people suffer poor
eyesight, simply eyes get dry. incredible, believe not,
lubricating mechanisms eye, not just tears, thin sheet oil. mean, just


amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even

amazing. Unless sort corneal abrasion, cornea clear stuff
outside eye, corneal abrasion, blink, smooth, don't feel it.
just really, really smooth. yet, ever corneal scratch, this,
really rough, painful. ton pain receptors cornea.
lubrication cornea supported blinking. seems little silly,
people actually benefit some, know, five 10 15 seconds blinking,
focused work. people, eyes drying out,
focus, trying something, eyelids stay open, eyes can dry out,
also can make such, blink next time, kind need
focus, distortions oils liquids across corneal
surface. somebody suffers dry eye, hope find treatment
cure dry eye soon. isn't one present. Someone stands make lot
money can find cure dry eye. Let companies know start
company, right now still mystery that. blinking five 15
seconds, probably slowly, not quickly video, just, know,
maybe blink every second two 15 seconds can lubricate eyes.
not directly related anything neural, just going allow optics eye
clear. Just like screen phone gets dirty, like Costello's texting
phone, pick up, like covered smudge, clean off order
see things clearly, thing happening optical devices front
brain. Remember, brain. Okay, lot protocols today, almost
behavioral protocols. want talk little bit vision works
internally. also want talk foods supplements
shown support vision offset visual loss,

01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity;
Protocol 12

maybe even reverse visual loss. talk binocular vision lazy eye.
familiar lazy eye, kid, went swimming one day, one
day, didn't goggles. so, something must happening,
recall, eye moving water, always problem
can freestyle stroke off one side. people swim always
laughing. Somehow, kind move toward drowning try breathe right


side. think asymmetry way organized. Anyway, off
left, eye kept going water, chlorine water,
making uncomfortable, just closed eye. just decided,
know, knew less swim straight-ish. Might've bounced off lane lines
times, just use eye kind steer mark wall. Got
pool, took shower, dried off, completely lost binocular vision
three days, completely. young brain, age seven, maybe even
extending age 12 extremely vulnerable differences ocular input
two eyes. scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovering called critical periods, periods time brain plastic,
able change. two guys, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, thank you,
David Torsten, forever changed face visual neuroscience forever
changed way think treatment young brain. used thought
wouldn't want surgery young kid, risk anesthesia young
individuals. now know need repair imbalances, even
hours, okay, don't want scare anybody, talk reversal. hours
occluding one eye early life can lead permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes way brain perceives outside world,
eye opened again, brain actually can't make sense anything
coming it. shuts visual pathway somehow. happened
was, actually was, eye fine. got pool, opened eye,
couldn't see eye. Everything blurry, double vision, unless covered
eye, see perfectly fine. Fortunately, went ophthalmologist
understood literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, understood literature
made clear needed occlude eye, eye
working well. Clearly, understood work Huber Wiesel. Now,
again, don't want start playing games kind stuff kid.
wear, say Halloween costume wear eye patch,
pirate something Halloween, cover one side, probably
night Halloween, okay. not recommend recreationally don't
need young child child that. Because, indeed, create
imbalances brain machinery compares information coming two
eyes, can shut neural information occluded, closed eye. Now,
able reverse issue, binocular vision never terrific. much


better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision
dominant way evaluate world around us. turns hallucinations


under-activation visual system, compensatory, compensation,
visual system creates activity hallucinations. dark
long enough,

01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: Simple, Cost-Free Way Test & Maintain
Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-

forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,

people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought
hallucinations arise, over-activation activation certain aspects
visual system. just briefly want mention paper published good
friend phenomenal scientist physicist matter, Cris Niell
University Oregon Eugene. studied LSD light compounds discovered
hallucinations actually occur, portions brain become underactive.
visual portions brain under-stimulated. probably why, people go
cave retreats, something never done, don't think ever will do,
completely black, pretty soon, start hallucinating. start seeing things, even
though nothing there. visual system desperate make guesses
world. like eager beaver brain. like, there,
there, there? Even low no vision people, blind people,
are, brain going making guesses auditory
world. sounds there? touch sensations there? sighted folks,
going be, terms light? Light dominant way. Vision

Vision

start hallucinate see things. So, little note hallucinations. One
things can improve vision, also kind fun put
Snellen chart home. Snellen chart list letters. go
dreaded Department Motor Vehicles, actually renewal soon, love
Department Motor Vehicles. Department Motor Vehicles, cover
eye, read letters chart, letters course gets smaller smaller,
trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation
mechanisms eye muscles will vary, can take average.
also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,


generate, get chairs, walk run, take care ourselves.
Eyesight movement main ways able take care
take care others. start compromised eyesight compromised
movement, people need take care us, become much challenged
moving daily life. might seem nerdy Snellen chart
home, smooth pursuit exercise couple times week, get
outside hours day reading laptop work there, preserving
eyesight preserving vision one life-enhancing quality
life enhancing things can do. young person, can build
framework exercise brain training, want call that,
can immensely beneficial will really set really good vision
long period time. Now, course, genetic factors,
injury-related factors can compromise eyesight ability see. And,
course, things talking today aren't going solve issues,

01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow

can tremendous, positive impact willing just little bit
work, none involving cost, right? just time cost. want, want
talk things can perhaps improve vision. want dispel
myths stuff take improve vision. then, want just close talking
perceive time using vision, will nicely set stage
going talk next episode. now, understand lot
biology vision. understand light arrive retina get converted
electrical signals. process requires things like vitamin A, fat soluble vitamin.
requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et
cetera. want talk molecule lot supplements support
vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular
degeneration moderate macular degeneration, seem like lutein can
beneficial. not consumed raw egg yolks, although
highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. one A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
shown, excuse me, shown offset

know, drawbacks? Well, can go ever favorite examine.com.
do? Well, number different effects, huge number fact,
seem notably increase, now shown three studies, antioxidant enzyme
profile. number different effects, notable sake episode,
one ocular blood flow. seem increase amount ocular blood
flow, blood supply eyes, makes interesting compound.
number effects. whatever reason, also notable effect, several
studies shown this, fertility males. seems least double
pregnancy rate men take astaxanthin works as, particular, seems
men previously infertile. So, don't know something
blood flow eyes, probably not. probably something something
unrelated eyes. Nonetheless, effect molecule. also
shown positive effects things like skin elasticity, skin moisture, skin quality, et

T-H-I-N, people concerns Leber's optic neuropathies,
going small percentage people there, pretty severe condition,
supplements available there. encourage you, always,
talk ophthalmologist physician them. will say
number people take lutein things precautionary
measure, order bolster health way people take vitamins
minerals bolster health, people health, excuse me,
people averse taking vitamins minerals, 'cause feel like
can get healthy, whole foods. course, can get things
whole foods. question whether not can get concentrations
sufficient. think years come, going see lutein.
think going see compounds like astaxanthin,
hopefully able pronounce it. But, present, things
less kind experimental self-experimental phase. good
double-blind placebo controlled studies, like egg yolk buttermilk study things
published really good journals. Journal Ophthalmology, Journal Investigative
Ophthalmology Vision Sciences, good journals. journals
peer-reviewed experts. study mentioned earlier keeping rooms dark


also published excellent journal, think JAMA. go back look,
not screen longer, easy find, follow-up

01:44:20 Summary Protocols, Vital Point Blood & Oxygen Vision

doesn't necessarily mean want run start taking stuff
described, even protocols described, given array, palette,

Depending good vision is, family history vision vision loss,
occupational hazards. know, people work metal filings flying
machines going higher degree vision, know, risk visual

tried give array behavioral tools, touch upon
supplementation tools. remiss didn't say that, blood flow critical
neurons eye, remember, metabolically active cells
entire body, cells within retina, blood flow required get

better dart board still not good close one eye. much better
pool table, close one eye, still terrible. kid in, know,
outfield. know, ball coming towards me, ball's coming towards me,
going catch ball, like hit square lip. binocular vision isn't great
consequence early event. hard time binocular
stereograms, images kind of, supposed look them,
binocular depth image like pops out. kids going, oh, the,
whatever, Statue Liberty. [inaudible], see dots. Okay,
binocular vision, use cues. use near-far cues talked before.
Motion parallax, fact things closer moving faster things
away, order judge depth. years later, got involved in, don't
suggest people, got involved boxing martial arts
younger. sometimes will see fighters, slip avoid getting punched. also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth moving head, not
using mechanisms accommodation, okay? lot birds monkeys
animals will judge depth moving head like this, move side side.
Animals will undulate sometimes actually depth measurement,
move side side, brain able math depth.
mean terms protocols? young person, best get really
good binocular vision, not just level phone tablet, also distance,
will build strong binocular visual machinery brain level eyes
eye musculature. Now, somebody occlusion,
needed cover eye create imbalance, weak eye,
so-called lazy eye, sometimes referred amblyopia, eye work
harder. me, patched eye made eye, eventually, got vision
eye back. opened up. Now, might ask,
happens cover eyes early life? gets interesting.
might think, well, covering one eye leads poor vision eye eye
open, covering eyes will probably make blind, right? Actually, not
happens. Hubel Wiesel discovered affirmed many, many
times subsequent studies competitive, two eyes
competing real estate brain. actually cover eyes, actually
extend period critical plasticity. really interesting aspect people
starting leverage now, terms reopen plasticity later life. please


don't, know, go around eyes covered long. like
retreats stuff people go caves absolutely no vision. creates
hallucinations. talk just moment, suggestion.

01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training

Try get balanced visual input two eyes. Almost everybody
dominant eye. usually doesn't relate dominant hand, although can.
me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

me, cover right eye, see much less well, much poorly. little bit
fuzzy, work harder order see camera instance. Then, cover
left eye, actually really easy relax. dominant eye. Now,
can balance covering dominant eye little bit day,
warn young people, meaning, know, 12 younger, creating
imbalances isn't clinical need that. strong imbalances
two eyes, can caused cataract lens issues, can caused
neuromuscular issues, et cetera, try get dealt early possible
contacting really good ophthalmologist ideally neuro-ophthalmologist.
normal, say, common young children, babies eye
that, strabismus, either deviates deviates in. important correct
that. like balanced division two eyes brain
respond equally two eyes have, say high fidelity, quality vision.
Although people eye drifts can function normally life,
opportunity early life rescue that. won't do, well, maybe will this, can
actually relax eye. weak, cases, actually can start deviate.
Here, just here. not crossing eyes. actually can move my, can
misalign eyes, fight hard musculature eye,
keep eye aligned eye. eye
exercises, since twenties, 'cause noticed study lot, eye
start drift in, start see double, then, next thing know,
just covering eye up, getting weaker weaker, just like atrophy
muscle. went doctor, do? exact wrong thing.
optometrist went gave prism, adjusted see things
normally, just made eye weaker weaker. like putting weak arm
sling. spend least three years 10 minutes day, recommend,


near-far, covering good eye, near-far bad eye. now,
10, 12 years pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many
aren't dealing this, early childhood issues. might
experiencing challenges fatigued eyes differences focus two
eyes. eye exercises near-far, smooth pursuit, checking dominant
non-dominant eye can beneficial. again, not clinician, don't want to,
know, give protocols enforce protocols anybody. need figure
right safe you, given vision history. recommend talking really
good ophthalmologist severe vision problems kind, want
offset vision problems kind. optometrist well,

01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: Consequence Under-Active Visual Brain

ideally neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, mention hallucinations,
fun talk think about. years, people asked,
people get visual hallucinations. Costello's sleep right now, can probably hear
snoring, snoring loud. probably hallucinations rabbits, pizza,
mainly favorite, sleep. dreaming sleep sleep.
Hallucinations property visual system, always thought

trying figure roughly vision is. Cover eye,
that. people including nerdy, vision scientists like Snellen charts
office home many years now, can just practice, can
see sitting particular distance. Your, something not
often mentioned, performance Snellen chart will vary depending time
day, level fatigue ability control accommodation

also good thing, going get vision tested corrective lenses, maybe
going laser surgery, something sort, thinking
that, really get measured professional. ones get
supermarkets, many eyeglass stores, apologies eyeglass stores, often
wrong order magnitude. then, start putting corrective lenses
over-correcting under-correcting, often over-correcting, well,
essentially weakening system. like putting prosthetic limb
didn't necessarily need, robot arm didn't need use robot arm.
Although now much excitement robots, think people going
anyway. Nonetheless, get vision tested somebody really
understands vision, like ophthalmologist really good optometrist. put
Snellen chart home, know, can part visual training.
Now, might seem excessively nerdy, important eyesight,
right? Eyesight vital. right movement ability move,

requires things like carotinoids. metabolic cascade, biochemical cascade,
essential vision. told carrots help see better
'cause high vitamin A. simple things can support
vision. First all, true eating vegetables, dark, leafy vegetables
things like carrots vitamin abundance, eating close
raw form, naturally occurring foods contain lot vitamin raw form can
help support vision. Now, mean ingest super physiological amounts
stuff, going make vision much better? No, need
threshold level vitamin order see order see well. Now, lot


excitement nowadays supplementation help support health visual
system. somebody pretty open novel forms supplementation.
probably gathered that, listening podcast awhile.
determine safe, economical, right you, risk tolerance is, et

vision, really good data on, lutein. Now, study want
describe actually published 2016. Journal Ophthalmology.
good journal. title paper is, might catch attention, "Increased
macular pigment optical density," just means macula, area eye
central vision, high acuity vision. Pigment density good, want pigment
there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and visual acuity," Visual acuity
ability see things fine detail. "Following consumption buttermilk drink
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like Rocky movie, drink raw egg yolks. "A
randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, not suggesting go
eat raw egg yolks. risk salmonella. Although, hear this, someone
correct wrong, salmonella actually outside egg, not
actually egg itself, shell. reasons relate egg got
world, salmonella lives, wrong that. raw egg
yolks not something people want consume. lutein stuff?
Well, lutein pathway relates vitamin formation OPs
photopigment captures light back eye, literally absorbs light pigment
eye, converts electrical signals, allows see.
evidence, spoke chair ophthalmology, evidence
quality peer-reviewed studies supplementing lutein can help offset
detrimental effects age-related macular degeneration. But, want emphasize but,
emphasize however, individuals moderate severe macular degeneration.
people normal vision, a, just low-degree macular degeneration,
studies not see significant improvement vision supplementing
lutein. So, not going tell supplement lutein not. don't think
study holy, seem moderate severe macular
degeneration, talk physician, course, talk ophthalmologist, always
say that, say three times, supplementing lutein perhaps support
vision offset vision loss case. Probably also talk


ophthalmologist consider red light therapy talked earlier. Whereas,
normal vision, low amount macular degeneration, not seem,
least studies, lutein much effect. Now, know, confess
sort mind personally age-related macular degeneration,
propensity family, fortunately don't, case, think
supplementing lutein, provided safe, perhaps benefit. might
want consider low dose that. again, not pushing anybody
means, know that, certain conditions severe macular

highest density source. Cooking egg yolk, cooking eggs, like
scrambled eggs dry, like eggs not easy whatever, not runny,
aren't going get benefits leucine. sources leucine,
non-animal sources leucine well. can look internet. Now,
compounds shown perhaps important offsetting
helping different forms vision loss. One is, going spell out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-
N-E, idebenone, idebenone, idebenone, can never pronounce compounds,
forgive me, unless worked them. evidence can beneficial
Leber's congenital eye disease. definitely go examine.com, put I-D-E-B-
N-O-N-E. things like Leber's optic neuropathies, degenerative
condition eye, whether not people just taking stuff anyway still
open question. aren't lot studies it. lot people interested
taking things support vision taking lutein preventative measure. don't
pass judgment one way other. Typically, supplements also include
zeaxanthins astaxanthins. Okay, pronunciation terrible, sure,
not far off, basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. can see hard
