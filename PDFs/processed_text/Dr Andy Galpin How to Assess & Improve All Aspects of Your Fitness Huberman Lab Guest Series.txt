one functionality. want able perform certain way. Now, again,
definition differs per person. want better strength, want better
mobility, want able energy throughout day, whatever is.
sort appeal aesthetic sort appeal functionality.
within categories, want position can understand,
need go exercise training can fit healthy
achieve goals want now, well position can maintain
long period time. blends immediate goals. say just
interested squatting lot weights. Say interested running 5K time
best run. doesn't matter. blends desire long wellness span,
fit throughout life, achieve things long possible.
question kind comes back saying, well, know area need focus
most, not achieving goals, can get
effectively. look big picture, understand
several major components physical fitness going required
categories. achieve that, handful components happen
able hit goals. Now infinite methods. saying actually
use lot is, methods many, concepts few. love
today is, course discussion hit exactly concepts
cover whole bunch different methods. hours.
cover number various goals. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
reasons went neuroscience not exercise science thing
neuroplasticity, nervous system's ability adapt. time spend
learn you, realize many, not organ systems
body incredible ability adapt. talking physical
exercise, incredible adaptations that, course, involve nervous system,

00:05:40 9 Exercise-Induced Adaptations

also involve muscle connective tissue many cell types tissues.
said, talk fitness, major types adaptations
underlie thing call fitness? later, know going get
different forms exercise can trigger different types adaptations,
major adaptations one can create body using exercise? ANDY GALPIN:


many reasons one exercise, perhaps cover
later chats. physiological adaptations can bucketed really nine
areas. first one call skill technique. just learning move
better, efficiently specific position timing sequence, whatever
is. running effectively, practicing skill like shooting
ball implement, swinging golf club. Anything like that, call skill development.
second one speed, simply moving higher velocity better
rate acceleration. similar next one, power. power
speed multiplied force. next one then, course, top that, force
strength. really synonymous terms. effectively can move
something? Now, often confused-- strength, rather-- muscular endurance.
mean strength truly marker maximum thing can
move maximum amount force can produce one time. not
many repetitions row can do. actually another one adaptations
called muscular endurance. typically order say five 25, maybe
50 repetitions. Think classic many push-ups can row? many
sit-ups can minute? Things like muscular endurance. Muscular
endurance tends localized, specific just, say, triceps
deltoids. not overall cardiovascular endurance marker anything like that.
strength, number four. Number five muscle hypertrophy. first time
now talking appearance rather functional outcome. moving
better, moving faster, moving heavier indicators well can move.
first one just simply big muscle? muscle hypertrophy
muscle size. muscular endurance. many repetitions
can typically movement. think many push ups row can do,
many sit ups minute can do, things typically five 50 repetition
sort range. often almost always local muscle. mean
push-up test really many reps triceps pecs deltoids can do.
not cardiovascular endurance. not global physiological endurance.
specific to, typically, one muscle groups time.
multiple tests every group there. that, now moved number seven,
call anaerobic capacity. synonymous maximum heart
rate. now actually looking at, rather single movement muscle group,
total physiological limitation. maximum amount work can in,


say, 30 45 seconds, maybe even 120 seconds, all-out work. Think
classic interval type stuff here. much work can maximum rate,
going enter tremendous amounts global fatigue? next past
maximal aerobic capacity. probably actually something like eight 15
minute range, going reach probably maximum heart rate well
true VO2 max, talk lot later. different
previous one, can't reach matter seconds. simply takes
multiple minutes get position VO2 max actually going
sufficiently challenged indicator there. last one, number nine,
call long duration. just ability sustain submaximum work long
period time no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. often called steady state
training lot people just think think of, quote, unquote, "cardio,"
ability continue move without breaks change drop last
final adaptation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: long distance steady state,
guessing exceeds 15 minutes because-- ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --the previous one eight 15 minutes so. sort rate ranges
talking terms long duration? ANDY GALPIN: Well, actually
wonderful. going anything past 15 minutes. really, look
minimal number there, generally 20 minutes looking for,
typical 20 60 minutes. anything past still limited
long-duration endurance, ability sustain work time. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK.

00:10:56 Assessing Fitness Levels per Category; Fat Loss & Health

given nine different major adaptations can induced
exercise specific types, one global test assessment people can
take allows determine level ability, fitness
every one nine different categories? ANDY GALPIN: probably
dozens tests can one nine categories.
actually like walk favorites giving
scientific gold standard-- ability, unlimited resources,
go do? well equipment-free, cost-free, things
anyone can across world. addition that, want walk


numbers be, identify really poor something
great. aren't good, maybe, category want get
better it, exactly terms protocols achieve optimal results
steps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noticed list nine different
adaptations exercise not mention fat loss health-promoting benefits,
two reasons lot people exercise. specific reason
not mention those? ANDY GALPIN: Absolutely. things actually
not specific training styles. byproducts nine. mean
understand fat loss occurs, can certainly talk about, realize
nine protocols effective fat loss not. General health
thing. understand actually means healthy
physiological perspective, rationale train going determine
itself. mean is, looking things like, order healthy,
sufficient strength, cardiovascular fitness,
sufficient muscle et cetera. Therefore, training one's health determined
restrictions. you, Andrew, may need strength training
healthy, me, strong already, way stronger you, may not need
much strength training. our, quote, unquote, "health-based protocols"
based current status limitations physical fitness among nine areas.
like today cover brief history exercise science.
reason going explain lot people not getting goals
exercise programs want well gives specific direction
instead.

00:13:33 Momentous, LMNT, Eight Sleep

ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't wait hear things incorrectly
help remedy that. begin, like emphasize podcast

partnering Momentous several important reasons. First all, mentioned,
supplements extremely high quality. Second all, supplements
generally single-ingredient formulations. going develop supplementation
protocol, going want focus mainly using single-ingredient formulations.
single-ingredient formulations, can devise logical effective
cost-effective supplementation regimen goals. addition, Momentous

brought us LMNT. LMNT electrolyte drink contains exact ratios
electrolytes sodium, magnesium, potassium optimize cellular functioning
mental physical performance. people realize hydration key. need
ingest enough fluids order feel best perform best, people
not realize proper functioning cells, nerve cells, neurons
particular, requires sodium, magnesium, potassium present correct
ratios. Now, course, people prehypertension hypertension need careful
sodium intake, lot people don't realize drink
caffeine, exercise, and, particular, following clean diet, not
lot processed foods, which, course, good thing, chances not

history exercise science informs mistakes making
remedy mistakes, curious whether not favorite one
two studies point naturally occurring example people can become
fit one area not another. familiar seeing endurance athletes
apparently terrific endurance but, least eye, don't look like
particularly strong. also familiar seeing individuals very, strong,
particularly social media, don't look like walk flight stairs,
much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

many reasons one exercise, perhaps cover
later chats. physiological adaptations can bucketed really nine
areas. first one call skill technique. just learning move
better, efficiently specific position timing sequence, whatever
is. running effectively, practicing skill like shooting
ball implement, swinging golf club. Anything like that, call skill development.
second one speed, simply moving higher velocity better
rate acceleration. similar next one, power. power
speed multiplied force. next one then, course, top that, force
strength. really synonymous terms. effectively can move
something? Now, often confused-- strength, rather-- muscular endurance.
mean strength truly marker maximum thing can
move maximum amount force can produce one time. not
many repetitions row can do. actually another one adaptations
called muscular endurance. typically order say five 25, maybe
50 repetitions. Think classic many push-ups can row? many
sit-ups can minute? Things like muscular endurance. Muscular
endurance tends localized, specific just, say, triceps
deltoids. not overall cardiovascular endurance marker anything like that.
strength, number four. Number five muscle hypertrophy. first time
now talking appearance rather functional outcome. moving
better, moving faster, moving heavier indicators well can move.
first one just simply big muscle? muscle hypertrophy
muscle size. muscular endurance. many repetitions
can typically movement. think many push ups row can do,
many sit ups minute can do, things typically five 50 repetition
sort range. often almost always local muscle. mean
push-up test really many reps triceps pecs deltoids can do.
not cardiovascular endurance. not global physiological endurance.
specific to, typically, one muscle groups time.
multiple tests every group there. that, now moved number seven,
call anaerobic capacity. synonymous maximum heart
rate. now actually looking at, rather single movement muscle group,
total physiological limitation. maximum amount work can in,


say, 30 45 seconds, maybe even 120 seconds, all-out work. Think
classic interval type stuff here. much work can maximum rate,
going enter tremendous amounts global fatigue? next past
maximal aerobic capacity. probably actually something like eight 15
minute range, going reach probably maximum heart rate well
true VO2 max, talk lot later. different
previous one, can't reach matter seconds. simply takes
multiple minutes get position VO2 max actually going
sufficiently challenged indicator there. last one, number nine,
call long duration. just ability sustain submaximum work long
period time no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. often called steady state
training lot people just think think of, quote, unquote, "cardio,"
ability continue move without breaks change drop last
final adaptation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: long distance steady state,
guessing exceeds 15 minutes because-- ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --the previous one eight 15 minutes so. sort rate ranges
talking terms long duration? ANDY GALPIN: Well, actually
wonderful. going anything past 15 minutes. really, look
minimal number there, generally 20 minutes looking for,
typical 20 60 minutes. anything past still limited
long-duration endurance, ability sustain work time. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK.

00:10:56 Assessing Fitness Levels per Category; Fat Loss & Health

given nine different major adaptations can induced
exercise specific types, one global test assessment people can
take allows determine level ability, fitness
every one nine different categories? ANDY GALPIN: probably
dozens tests can one nine categories.
actually like walk favorites giving
scientific gold standard-- ability, unlimited resources,
go do? well equipment-free, cost-free, things
anyone can across world. addition that, want walk


numbers be, identify really poor something
great. aren't good, maybe, category want get
better it, exactly terms protocols achieve optimal results
steps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noticed list nine different
adaptations exercise not mention fat loss health-promoting benefits,
two reasons lot people exercise. specific reason
not mention those? ANDY GALPIN: Absolutely. things actually
not specific training styles. byproducts nine. mean
understand fat loss occurs, can certainly talk about, realize
nine protocols effective fat loss not. General health
thing. understand actually means healthy
physiological perspective, rationale train going determine
itself. mean is, looking things like, order healthy,
sufficient strength, cardiovascular fitness,
sufficient muscle et cetera. Therefore, training one's health determined
restrictions. you, Andrew, may need strength training
healthy, me, strong already, way stronger you, may not need
much strength training. our, quote, unquote, "health-based protocols"
based current status limitations physical fitness among nine areas.
like today cover brief history exercise science.
reason going explain lot people not getting goals
exercise programs want well gives specific direction
instead.

00:13:33 Momentous, LMNT, Eight Sleep

ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't wait hear things incorrectly
help remedy that. begin, like emphasize podcast
separate teaching research roles Stanford. also separate Dr.
Galpin's teaching research roles Cal State Fullerton. is, however, part
desire effort bring zero cost consumer information science science-
related tools general public. keeping theme, like thank
sponsors today's podcast. first sponsor Momentous. Momentous make
supplements absolute highest quality. Huberman Lab podcast proud


partnering Momentous several important reasons. First all, mentioned,
supplements extremely high quality. Second all, supplements
generally single-ingredient formulations. going develop supplementation
protocol, going want focus mainly using single-ingredient formulations.
single-ingredient formulations, can devise logical effective
cost-effective supplementation regimen goals. addition, Momentous
supplements ship internationally. is, course, important realize
many Huberman Lab podcast listeners reside outside United States.

brought us LMNT. LMNT electrolyte drink contains exact ratios
electrolytes sodium, magnesium, potassium optimize cellular functioning
mental physical performance. people realize hydration key. need
ingest enough fluids order feel best perform best, people
not realize proper functioning cells, nerve cells, neurons
particular, requires sodium, magnesium, potassium present correct
ratios. Now, course, people prehypertension hypertension need careful
sodium intake, lot people don't realize drink
caffeine, exercise, and, particular, following clean diet, not
lot processed foods, which, course, good thing, chances not
getting enough sodium, potassium, magnesium optimize mental physical

history exercise science informs mistakes making
remedy mistakes, curious whether not favorite one
two studies point naturally occurring example people can become
fit one area not another. familiar seeing endurance athletes
apparently terrific endurance but, least eye, don't look like
particularly strong. also familiar seeing individuals very, strong,
particularly social media, don't look like walk flight stairs,
much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one

going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded

say, 30 45 seconds, maybe even 120 seconds, all-out work. Think
classic interval type stuff here. much work can maximum rate,
going enter tremendous amounts global fatigue? next past
maximal aerobic capacity. probably actually something like eight 15
minute range, going reach probably maximum heart rate well
true VO2 max, talk lot later. different
previous one, can't reach matter seconds. simply takes
multiple minutes get position VO2 max actually going
sufficiently challenged indicator there. last one, number nine,
call long duration. just ability sustain submaximum work long
period time no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. often called steady state
training lot people just think think of, quote, unquote, "cardio,"
ability continue move without breaks change drop last
final adaptation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: long distance steady state,
guessing exceeds 15 minutes because-- ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --the previous one eight 15 minutes so. sort rate ranges
talking terms long duration? ANDY GALPIN: Well, actually
wonderful. going anything past 15 minutes. really, look
minimal number there, generally 20 minutes looking for,
typical 20 60 minutes. anything past still limited
long-duration endurance, ability sustain work time. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK.

00:10:56 Assessing Fitness Levels per Category; Fat Loss & Health

given nine different major adaptations can induced
exercise specific types, one global test assessment people can
take allows determine level ability, fitness
every one nine different categories? ANDY GALPIN: probably
dozens tests can one nine categories.
actually like walk favorites giving
scientific gold standard-- ability, unlimited resources,
go do? well equipment-free, cost-free, things
anyone can across world. addition that, want walk


numbers be, identify really poor something
great. aren't good, maybe, category want get
better it, exactly terms protocols achieve optimal results
steps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noticed list nine different
adaptations exercise not mention fat loss health-promoting benefits,
two reasons lot people exercise. specific reason
not mention those? ANDY GALPIN: Absolutely. things actually
not specific training styles. byproducts nine. mean
understand fat loss occurs, can certainly talk about, realize
nine protocols effective fat loss not. General health
thing. understand actually means healthy
physiological perspective, rationale train going determine
itself. mean is, looking things like, order healthy,
sufficient strength, cardiovascular fitness,
sufficient muscle et cetera. Therefore, training one's health determined
restrictions. you, Andrew, may need strength training
healthy, me, strong already, way stronger you, may not need
much strength training. our, quote, unquote, "health-based protocols"

history exercise science informs mistakes making
remedy mistakes, curious whether not favorite one
two studies point naturally occurring example people can become
fit one area not another. familiar seeing endurance athletes
apparently terrific endurance but, least eye, don't look like
particularly strong. also familiar seeing individuals very, strong,
particularly social media, don't look like walk flight stairs,
much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

mile. also Sir Edmund Hillary sherpa, Norgay, summit
Everest same, basically, two-year span. exact year
formation called American College Sports Medicine. Now, still
around today. preeminent group Exercise Medicine.
interested things like exercise obesity prevention, cancer treatment, things
like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

history exercise science informs mistakes making
remedy mistakes, curious whether not favorite one
two studies point naturally occurring example people can become
fit one area not another. familiar seeing endurance athletes
apparently terrific endurance but, least eye, don't look like
particularly strong. also familiar seeing individuals very, strong,
particularly social media, don't look like walk flight stairs,
much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

history exercise science informs mistakes making
remedy mistakes, curious whether not favorite one
two studies point naturally occurring example people can become
fit one area not another. familiar seeing endurance athletes
apparently terrific endurance but, least eye, don't look like
particularly strong. also familiar seeing individuals very, strong,
particularly social media, don't look like walk flight stairs,
much less run mile. examples studies outside laboratory
point concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: lot discuss here,
answer really clear. look across literature-- actually back early
mid 1950s. fact, actually goes back previous that, Harvard Fatigue
Lab, 1927 1947 area. People actually advocating, point, combination
strength training endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 1920s? ANDY GALPIN:
Way back then. fact, actually goes prior that. late 1880s, scientific
evidence back then. became well-developed mid 1950s '60s. fact,
initial stages called Exercise Medicine Movement,
movement now, initial stages actually route back 1950s.
actually go whole discussion story came about,


Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

Health Wealth mantra came 1950s, scientific
community then. data points going suggest need combination
sort broad strength training broad endurance. Now, specific
goal five months now, want compete race hit certain physique thing,
fine focus one area training. Certainly, athlete, different.
want maximize health overall functionality throughout time, needs
combination. really, really highlight this, can actually talk couple
studies done. One actually Stockholm, Sweden.
Karolinska Institute, probably aware of. actually one
founding places exercise physiology. Generally, started there. called
something different back then, really, entire field came Stockholm
Karolinska Institute. worked whole bunch cross-country skiers
80s 90s. competitive skiers 1940s '50s,
skiing competitively entire duration. talking 50 60
consecutive years competing. 80 90-year-olds, living alone
healthy. compared group individuals America
age not exercising. wanted see look at,
lifelong endurance individuals? look like?
brought lab, is, way, amazing, VO2 max test 92-
year-old, especially language don't speak, can imagine,
hospital. running people through, cycling task.
VO2 max test, mask face, hooked metabolic cart
can collect gases coming mouth, chanting
people on. basically, every minute, workload gets harder harder
harder can't complete it. cardiology center,
cardiologists usually waiting heart rate get slightly elevated stop
85, 86 years old. not not stopping them,
screaming ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Swedish
English? ANDY GALPIN: English. translator-- doesn't take lot
translation someone's screaming face, go, go, go. ran
whole bunch VO2 max tests. thing folks back
America. incredibly clear study VO2 max-- can
think numbers, called relative. relative terms
milliliters per kilogram per minute. standard number 18, call


line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts


behavioral do's don'ts, sorts nutritional changes, sorts

you. like try InsideTracker, can visit insidetracker.com/huberman get
20% off InsideTracker's plans.

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

line independence. VO2 max 18 milliliters per kilogram per
minute, hard live yourself. fitness low, probably
going need somebody living need sort
assisted living home. VO2 max 20 21 22, not
line independence, threshold. found folks
America, group average right around number. living
home, definition. picked people living 80s
not living home, didn't bandwidth. got cold
anything pop lost little bit fitness, going drop
line probably go sort assisted living situation. folks
Stockholm, cross-country skiers, group average much closer 35 38
milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, number VO2 max
find normal college male. folks literally 80 90-- joke,
sabertooth tiger ran room whatever chased
run see didn't get eaten alive, college men probably gotten eaten
90-year-olds. one case, 92-year-old individual. think
VO2 max 38, was, estimation, world record, highest VO2 max
somebody age 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May ask typical
resting heart rate somebody fit, like older Swedish cross-country skiers?
somebody has-- say number 35 millimeters per kilogram VO2 max
test, since us don't access kind equipment, can
measure pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. mean, typically good number
go off anybody, regardless age. time see somebody that, going
start asking questions. Certainly above-- see literature people will say 60
80 normal, don't agree all. resting heart rate 75 beats per
minute, either something going not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
much cross-country skiing doing, average, previous, say,
take previous 20 years since longtime cross-country skiers. Divide
20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: average,
people cross-country skiing five hours day, two hours day, hour day? ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah, actually good question. don't remember. many years,
not every single day. volume not shocked


you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

formation called American College Sports Medicine. Now, still
around today. preeminent group Exercise Medicine.
interested things like exercise obesity prevention, cancer treatment, things
like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

you. consistency 50 years got there. Now, obviously,
people were, again, world champions Olympic gold medalists 1940s '50s,
elite. just continued consistently time, wasn't shocking
amount physical fitness. also didn't go way train hard.
busy chopping wood. busy number things. just
happened races ski along way, wasn't crazy amount
like, oh, great, never hit number. something
much reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: takeaway consistent
getting cardiovascular exercise? can define "consistent" means
terms days per week little bit later, know will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: examples? love examples
real world. ANDY GALPIN: downside, though. told
VO2 max. didn't tell leg strength functionality.
part no superior counterparts not exercisers.
showed really, really clearly-- many studies done since
look classic, call lifelong endurance exercisers. will see,
general, VO2 max, cardiovascular function, resting heart rate, blood
pressure. will markedly healthier folks don't exercise. extraordinarily
clear type exercise important chronic disease management, no doubt
it. However, not sufficient overall global health almost
nothing leg strength, marker health, can talk about,
things actually going predict mortality, morbidity most.
big smashing indication like, hey, great. However, leaving things
table overall health. Now, one argue, 80,

00:26:10 Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins

pretty well, weren't well areas.
study later, actually, follow-up looking monozygous twins.
actually interesting. scientist, classic example one graduate
students lab probably three four years.
single fiber physiology lab. can imagine, isolating individual muscle fibers,
athlete, one one tweezer. going several thousand
individual cells. hours, things happen there. kind


lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

lose mind. going one day one colleagues just
talking, like, oh yeah, uncle really, really fit something
then. Oh yeah, twin. like, oh, monozygous? like,
yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't know, monozygous identical
twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, interesting. basically have--
setting perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical
twins mean exact DNA. egg fertilized, split, two
humans grew exact DNA. now can start answering
question, well, yeah, OK. about, maybe, cross-country skiers? Maybe
just genetic freaks. Maybe didn't matter. like people have-- well,
genetics always component it, much? Well, now scenario
lining like, wait minute. monozygous twins.
replica human being, exact DNA. differences see
physiology now due lifestyle circumstances. Interesting.
monozygous twin dad uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. exercise? Well, one
does. lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman,
things. one? Nope. doesn't exercise all.
point, wanted kill graduate student like, lab
three years more, probably, never told household
perfect scientific experiment exercise ever create. Jesus, look
face colleague staring her. just like, oh god.
like, call right now. coming lab. Fly Chicago. don't
care do. getting in. wanted to-- actually, going
back model first developed Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing
interesting community started off concept trying examine
human performance holistic lens. antithesis looking
either organ organ, going look cardiovascular system.
going look skeletal muscle. saying, looking entire
picture. model, wanted carry twins. said,
right, want bring lab, not just going look one system. want
everything. took stool samples. took blood. vertical jump tests.
maximum strength tests. MRIs muscle mass. VO2 max tests.
efficiency stuff. genetic testing. IQ test. psychological
battery. wanted look everything figure things, differ


twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

interested things like exercise obesity prevention, cancer treatment, things
like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

twins? so, second key question is, much? can
improve VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, much? Can change
5%, 80%? number? putting quantification
important. again, another example classic endurance-only training
paradigm compared non. person who's, think, truck driver
vocation. think, actually, drove potato chip company, even funnier.
endurance athlete actually great because, like endurance people,
physical books training mileage last 35 years. just went
them, calculated total amount miles ran, averages,
heart rates per time. unbelievable thing, races in.
documentation. just totally nuts, something endurance people like
shaking head right now going, oh, yeah. got too. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
endurance folks pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right?
great now validate, close one could, actually much
ran things like that. 35-year discord. exercised
high school. 18, stopped it, time got
lab, mid-50s. 35 years difference. ran
testing, look measures similar Sweden
study, almost identical. exercising twin significantly better things like
lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. markers,
predicted, much better. interesting, though, things
middle. First all, total amount muscle mass almost identical,
gram, within margin error DEXA scan possibly ever be. non-
exerciser, though, little bit fatter. difference actual body weight
explained almost entirely body fat non-lean tissue, really, sort deal.
OK. No one's surprised exerciser little bit leaner, even though
didn't change total amount muscle mass all. looked
functional tests looked things like muscle quality-- metric can
get ultrasound. can kind think much fat inside
tissue, sometimes advantage endurance athlete little bit
called intramuscular triglycerides fuel directly
tissue. general, muscle quality not favor exerciser.
looked performance testing looked strength, favored non-
exerciser. now, again, finding saw Sweden study,


identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

identical twins. really, really highlighted fact want move
forward optimal health, simply picking one silo not going get there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN:
Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean twin not exercise
jump higher win arm wrestling competition? Not vital thing able
do, just terms measuring strength, isometric strength. non-
exercising twin stronger least strong exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN:
Yes, particularly grip strength. Yeah. measures like vertical jump,
leg extension power, number things, often favored non-exerciser,
still little bit chicken egg. don't know if, necessarily,
endurance training reduced twin's strength. doesn't even really matter, per
se. think highlight is, can change metrics VO2 max?
Yeah, not even close. things responsive regardless genetics.
genetics will give starting place clearly. Even non-exerciser
pretty healthy guy. good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really
pay attention diet all, pretty good shape. However, want
actually move progress move forward high functionality,
something besides just run, just distance run. Now, say thing
strength training. alone-- don't want make thing like saying
endurance exercises. worked. cases, studies, folks
much better off metrics incredibly important mortality,

00:33:49 Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise

long going live, VO2 max, et cetera. just not going get terms
strength. took look muscle fiber physiology well, interesting.
mean generally two types muscle fibers, fast-twitch slow-
twitch. one things hallmark aging selective reduction fast-
twitch fibers. difficult activate unless high-
force activities. going activate slow-twitch fibers almost activity
daily living. stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless something
high force going, not used. not going kept around.
problem look things like need leg strength aging,
ability catch fall, things incredibly important. don't


fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts


behavioral do's don'ts, sorts nutritional changes, sorts

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

fast-twitch fibers, don't speed get foot front
time, don't eccentric strength stop fall happening.
look across, again, aging literature, clear importance
maintaining strength fast-twitch fibers time. know
important distinction overall. people will often talk about, much
genetically determined? Can change fiber type? answer
resoundingly yes. can change exercise? answer is, absolutely
can. next question is, much? now, again, going see
order magnitude. general, without going far area maybe can
save later, one muscles body different percentage fast-
twitch slow-twitch, example, calf. look soleus,
smaller one goes back, generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80%
slow-twitch. gastroc, one right next it. point
toe next face part kind flexes middle pops out,
gastroc. almost inverse. generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe
20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal
erectors, things meant keep moving day, going slow-
twitch. things like hamstrings, explosion, going fast-
twitch. Well, biopsied quad individuals. muscle, generally
50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, really broad number. Well, one things
found non-exerciser, almost textbook predict.
50% slow-twitch, little bit percentage fast-twitch,
20% called hybrid fibers, hallmark activity. right.
Great. exerciser, 95% slow-twitch. extremely clear-- again,
don't know maybe set point little bit higher towards that, non-
exerciser devolved place one, doesn't matter. mean,
going 40% slow-twitch one case 95% slow-twitch another case.
shows limits physiological adaptation darn near boundless given
enough exposure. case, 35 years extremely consistent training, muscle
morphology completely different identical twin exact DNA.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: two beautiful examples people endurance
work number years

00:37:12 Lifetime Strength Training & Outcomes



gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.


think certain things matter

people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts


behavioral do's don'ts, sorts nutritional changes, sorts

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

gives terms benefits functionality. opposite
experiment done observed, somebody's just weight lifted just sprinted
number years? don't know identical twin control. little--
ANDY GALPIN: No. wish third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much
ask for. Right, triplets. triplets there, exercising different ways
people triplets, maybe assign one kid runner, one kid
weightlifter, one sedentary. Please don't experiments like that.
expectation, understand it, person sprints
heavy squats, explosive work, fast-twitch muscle fibers
quad. non-exercising counterpart fewer. make sense.
happens assess endurance level somebody just done
strength training just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. don't data
specifically. actually just starting studies come lifelong strength
trainers. actually good reason this, whole story can
get into, quick answer is, don't lot people who've lifting
weights 30-plus years. whole swath people who've
endurance training long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fewer people
weight training weight trainers dead? ANDY GALPIN:
got go back 1953, 1954. two major things happen changed entire
course exercise physiology exercise science and, really, exercise know it.
important understand history field. lot questions get based
false assumptions exercise can can't do. example, questions like
momentum. use momentum cheating, right? doesn't work.
compromises results. actually totally untrue. excellent reasons
use momentum lift. reasons not.
sometimes beneficial go fast exercise repetitions. Sometimes slow
controlled better. question get-- fact, infamous always
responding with, "It depends." reason say depends depends goal.
training speed power muscular endurance, answer
common question differs. people fail realize think
asking right question don't understand history,
planted brain subconsciously, driving question. not necessarily
right one. walk little bit, see field led.

people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

Everest same, basically, two-year span. exact year
formation called American College Sports Medicine. Now, still
around today. preeminent group Exercise Medicine.
interested things like exercise obesity prevention, cancer treatment, things
like that-- not really sports medicine. clinical exercise-- place
go, American College Sports Medicine. launching ton
people wanting start endurance exercise start swimming cycling
running. launch people coming off back Harvard
Fatigue Lab. fatigue lab actually shut 1947. people
interested physical fitness, nowhere go. Well, people left Harvard
fatigue. lab started labs places. launched careers


people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

people like Dave Costill John Holloszy famous exercise
physiologists. start building laboratories. start, first time ever,
studying science exercise. years go by, people happen. 1960s
1970s call runner's boom. people start-- fact, look
numbers people marathons, explodes two-decade
spans like, endurance feats. Notice feats
endurance, running short term well going there. No one thought anything
strength training why. late 1880s, famous
physician named-- George Winship, think name, big proponent
strength training. Well, died age 50 something heart attack.
terrified people strength training 70 years like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
stuff will kill doctor, trying-- running around
country, exhibitions reporting it, died. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sort like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
dying. Although people say died heart attack. people said fell
ice cold water. debated, fact heavy proponent
given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
good business. ANDY GALPIN: now little storm brewing. 1940s--
going back little bit, bear second-- guy named Peter
Karpovich, scientist Springfield, decorated physical education, PE,
legendary place, Springfield College. anti strength training lot
reasons. entire career, talked about, don't this. one
launched ideas strength training will make lose flexibility, will bad
kids, things know now clearly not true. proponent
things. show happened Springfield College, guy named Bob
York-- you-- York Barbell, still around today-- going around country
putting exhibitions. come Springfield, sort like new-age
social media thing, like, students know happen
Karpovich shows event. everyone knows hates strength training.
everyone like waiting end, just see going say. whole
exhibition goes on, people doing-- got remember back
time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman,
thing. no differentiation yet. finishes, Karpovich stands up,
crowd goes silent. just asks one question. just points one guys


says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

says, scratch back. now just assuming waiting guy
like, ah not able put hand behind head. think pointed John
Grimek, famous bodybuilder. reached back scratched back, no
problem. proceeded grab two dumbbells-- think 50-pounds
dumbbells-- backflip, standing backflip hand. started
splits stage, start performing kinds physical function tests.
Karpovich stunned. like, holy-- nothing say. leaves there,
whole life changed. things claiming shown, face,
false. 180 career. starts running study study strength
training starts finding immediately no detriments strength training
terms global health. course, can wrong things like that. fact,
comes whole bunch benefits. 1950s, thing going
endurance folks, no one's still strength training no record
see. no American College Sports Medicine. no societies. no
science. not sure safe. meanwhile, Karpovich just hammering study
study study showing safe, safe, safe, hasn't picked yet.
everything changed 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. came
trifold. hits pumping iron, know know movie, right?
Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: interesting movie. Even not
interested bodybuilding, interesting movie really gives window
not just him, way weight training started show regular
practice. growing up, people weight trained people
preparing football, bodybuilders, basically didn't exist town grew
up. people yoga yogis Bikram, now drive
major American city European city yoga studios,
gyms free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold
Schwarzenegger largely responsible, think, initiating shift. ANDY GALPIN:
Yup. think it. hit us Pumping Iron, Conan,
Terminator, almost back-to-back-- close, within years. got whole
cascade '70s people running, cycling, swimming. Now, science starting
come not dangerous maybe, actually, benefit. boom.
Not not bad you, can make real world superhero. mean, think
psychology child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think
Batman looked like 1950s '60s. boom. can look like that?


Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets
see specific numbers are, course, also sorts


behavioral do's don'ts, sorts nutritional changes, sorts

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

Now, not everyone wants look like Arnold, see power can land
people. No one ever seen thought can make body transform like that.
maybe born like that, no chance. within grasp you.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: kid growing up, one favorite books
Guinness Book World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
still images mind coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: longest lifespan, et cetera. picture
Arnold Schwarzenegger. know record was? said, perfectly
developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: is,
point out, isn't physique people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN:
doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: inspire shift.
thing resistance training think certain allure people, men
women, one forms exercise enhanced blood
flow muscle occurs training, so-called "pump," gives
transient somewhat real window results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100%
ANDREW HUBERMAN: run gasping air, aren't
experiencing like faster day. ANDY GALPIN:
correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: weight train, get aesthetic picture
functionality aesthetic will change. disappears hours later--
ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as so-called "pump" subsides,
interesting form exercise way. almost go learn
language process learning, brief moments, actually fluent,
gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: puts
dopamine carrot front you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just hypothesizing weight training might taken off way
did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, mean, like got paid every hour hour
working. end day, take money back,
still-- time clock going day, looking up, watching
bank account grow real life. can see addicting folks.
finish story here, going back actual question answer. happening
late '70s, early '80s. now Joe Wieder, gyms, exploding
people want look like realize chance change
physically look. never reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mostly men point, guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah,


large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help

simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

large number reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even endurance stuff,
get fitter run faster better, wasn't going change
looked unless losing fat. Now can change look,
incredibly addicting. fact, famous quote. think actually Joe
Wieder said, "Show one man wants strong, show 10
want look strong." like, very, powerful. whole--
tons history can go into, sort explaining you. now know
mid- '80s, call generation.
generation, fall love strength training 1980s '90s, really
no scientific field it. not really come yet. science endurance
exercise physiology now humming along massive rate people
came '70s '80s, five, 10, 15 years career.
producing. generating graduate students. starting labs.
exercise physiology, still day, 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost
exclusively. Well, now generation, love sports. love lifting. love
things. now see happen Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking
strength training. Ooh. TV. SportsCenter mid 1990s, lifting
weights. go back, actually, late 1970s. not sure football
fan, football fan will recognize Nebraska Cornhuskers 1970s '80s
changed football's played. Well, reason started strength
training. started guy named Boyd Epley, founder
NFCA. National Strength Conditioning Association formed late 1970s
well. just like ASCM developed year two events happened,
1978, year Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA formed. now
scientific organization dedicated strength conditioning. got NFL strength
conditioning coaches starting come board.

00:51:26 Bodybuilding & Misconceptions; Circuit/Group Training

got scientists starting come labs. strength conditioning
becomes scientific field. Well, everything swings now, exercise perspective,
bodybuilding. almost things-- fact, sort talking before,
run whole bunch tricks you. ask whole bunch
questions things think absolute standards guarantees


training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing

optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want

mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

training. supposed this. never supposed that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
instance? ANDY GALPIN: instance, OK train muscle group back-to-
back days? people home thinking, no, not supposed train muscle-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: needs recover. ANDY GALPIN: total nonsense.
things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, things
like cardio, endurance training influencing, will ruin gains lift?
things base assumptions come bodybuilding. Now,
fantastic world, everything started late 1970s bodybuilding,
terms of-- basically strength training that. Weightlifting powerlifting not
around. were, nobody cared. Again, show someone wants
strong. show 10 want look strong. physique thing just dominated,
not getting yet. not way it. starting to, though,
why. People started realize, bodybuilding thing fantastic. can
change physique. getting better, damn, workouts take hour
half, two hours. going spend whole time one two body parts,
means going lift six days week, going
consistently. Now sudden, boom. Two hours elbow flexors. Damn,
elbow's starting hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: yet, understanding
doesn't really require two hours day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not all. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --of training order get benefits, even just hypertrophy. ANDY
GALPIN: Totally. lot times, going get amount time
spending much isolation. gone away training
movement, running movement, cycling movement, training biceps
muscle muscle group, training hamstrings muscle group. not human
movement. done 180 terms selecting exercises movement-
based prescription now muscle group-based training. isolating muscle
groups, means whole chunk body really not much throughout
day. happens doing, say, legs Monday miss Monday
flight? Now legs wait whole week,
starts become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing,
actually don't feel great. not super fit. sweating just walking stairs.
breath. Why? training, done nothing
cardiovascular fitness. done nothing improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood
flow. paradigm swung way hard exercising, especially lifting


weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based
information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break acknowledge
sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes
data blood DNA help better understand body help
reach health goals. long believer getting regular blood work done
simple reason many factors impact immediate long-term
health well-being can analyzed quality blood test. One issue
lot blood tests DNA tests there, however, get information back
various levels lipids hormones metabolic factors, et cetera,
don't know information. InsideTracker makes knowing
information exceedingly easy. personalized platform lets

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

weights, single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff.
left giant opening people going, well, wait minute. get
gym, can promise better result 30 minutes? And, fact,
also feel better. lose weight. opened group exercise classes,
kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type stuff, circuit training can come in, won't
get beat volume lower, time much lower. get multiple
adaptations time. Great. problem that, though, fast forward 10
years, started burying people now de-emphasized movement
quality, overemphasized scores. classic example. go
watch Pumping Iron bodybuilder, see bicep curl,
don't even really pay attention rep range. don't really pay attention
load. looking muscle. trying figure out, get thing
fire? squeezing. flexing. posing end every set.
trying figure out, getting enough pumps? exclusively founded
exercise quality. rep brains, numbers, almost irrelevant. go
model, exercise technique, doesn't matter. Just get amount weight
amount reps fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: CrossFit. walked past CrossFit. done two
CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: don't want get sued. said "CrossFit."
didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no enjoyed them. definitely felt like working
hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: observed lot people
close proximity Olympic lifts kipping-- kick
legs, folks, say, sort like bucking kipping type pull-ups. No. enjoyed it. wasn't
long term, seem lot ballistic movement
close proximity people. hazard seemed
actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, point setting is,
actually really brilliant solution lot problems classic bodybuilding
hypertrophy introduced. got away isolation movements got people
big movements, effective, generally better. got people things fast
explosive. athletic. important longevity. solved lot
problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. issue went just
pushed pace score rather quality. pushed pace many
people can time. now higher-risk movements,
higher intensity, higher fatigue, total-- not don't care


technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

technique, not thing concerned about. getting
number thing done. solved time issue, though. can get
tremendous results three days week, 45 minutes session, et cetera.
Burn people out, though. Way much high intensity, way often.

00:57:22 Women & Weight Training

problem, safety concerns, kinds orthopedic issues stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can interrupt moment just ask question,
go arc history endurance training predominated strength
training bodybuilding type training CrossFit type training think
fascinating, know arrive today-- ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and future looks like people
focus do. point, any, think resistance training started
become adopted women? no equivalent Arnold Schwarzenegger
Linda Hamilton Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
impressive physiques, certainly, female actresses athletes.
Williams sisters, impressive musculature physiques. And, course,
tennis playing speaks itself. happened yet? mean is, think,
since work men women, think women understand
weight training, done properly going extremely beneficial them, maybe
even especially them, terms offsetting bone density loss things sort?
still waiting popular stimulus getting 80% young women thinking,
want lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard answer not
woman. Now, daughter. four, see. can say is, probably
worked with-- don't know many professional athletes total. lot. worked
probably 14 professional sports. worked Cy Young winners, MVPs,
credentials. bet 35%, 40% athletes worked female. worked
Olympic gold medalists. worked bronze medallists multiple sports.
worked decorated powerlifter time number areas,
fighters, world championship, things. me, feel like burst already
happened. students, look classroom, don't know numbers are,
no small number females exercise science excess physiology.
look laboratories, one thing will see. female


exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

exercise scientists. female strength conditioning coaches,
number coming astronomical rate. people hired
every sport. pick NFL. pick Major League Baseball. Every months
hearing, first female hired this, first female hired that. Yankees, Rachel
Balkovec fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's lab.
terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. fantastic. mean, now hired
the-- think hitting coach now, actual sport coach. going GM.
goal. terminator. already happening. students
coming program getting placed roles. haven't gotten
yet lot terms actual scientist, getting there. Sports
scientists NBA hired, females, terms big data collection. sports
science tech, cover another discussion, think happening. Whether
not cultural social-- can't speak end equation. can speak
to, though, one things think fun coming forward scientifically
number years ago, NIH came mandates. saying, no
longer acceptable exclude women scientific research just
decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, happened-- just fill
think worth noting many years, studies even rodents mainly carried
male rodents assumption-- assumption turned
wrong-- assumption physiology female rodents--
don't menstrual cycle. not 28 days. estrus cycle. four days,
different type cycle-- somehow disrupt data. turns entirely
wrong. Now actually required. sit grant study panel,
people evaluate grants, ask. literally say, meet criteria
sex biological variable? not talking sex verb. talking
sex biological sex. don't say yes, strong hit grant.
say yes, checks off box. now required male
female rodents humans studied given study unless study specifically
geared toward understanding exists one population-- ANDY
GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such
menopause, instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --
menstrual cycle, andropause, instance. no, extremely important.
excited hear that. ANDY GALPIN: going go actually,
step one, cool. got include them. haven't gotten


yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth
control good example information women female athletes even just
hard exercisers-- don't competitive athlete-- around birth control
doing? types? manage that? conversations
doctor? Almost nothing. Women nothing go high-performance
stuff. trying compete event run race? types
questions answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing.
just not female. area. think-- somebody really wanted
make change, scientists want it. know it. talked many field
really love explore getting there. Like said, coaching
side getting there. seeing it. hiring people. seeing
students. followings not men. large percentage females,
post exercise science. do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

specific adaptations develop perfect protocols based

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

yet, seen grant applications come this, just
funding hasn't yet, is, one thing let women studies.
great. another thing, though, start performing high-performance research
specifically female questions. not happened yet. just funding
issue. haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. don't get lot
financial support sports science, can't track money yet going,
want study female athletes answers female athlete questions. won't
help men. questions specific female. next step.
got get can say, maybe things differently around training
recovery shouldn't doesn't matter. handful of-- not lower-quality,
studies. don't love yet. just needs ton work. Birth

podcast very-- know clearly audience 50% women, 50% men--

01:04:19 Exercise Physiology History & Current Protocol Design

ANDY GALPIN: nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which great. ANDY GALPIN:
just jump back history discussion finish point
now think going go go. walked
bodybuilding running everything people walking gym. time lift
weights, making choices based assumption maximizing
muscle size goal. clearly, not case. adaptations
may after. talked problems, talked


forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose
expertise

01:06:15 InsideTracker

01:07:18 Movement/Skill Test

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman get 20% off. understanding
mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

forms exercise filled gaps problems
things introduced. Well, think actually point pendulum slowly
shifting middle. mean is, want maximize muscle strength,
look towards power lifting community. want maximize muscle power,
going look weightlifting community. want look muscular
endurance, well-roundedness, maybe look CrossFit communities
obstacle course races functionality things. can now
generate protocols get us exact adaptations want not ones don't
want, can look back different styles training pick
choose optimal protocols combinations them. somebody simply wants get
healthy, like talked listed nine adaptations mentioned health
wasn't one them, determines health versus determines
optimal health differs. need hypertrophy, can look towards bodybuilding
concepts, enough maybe personal reasons, decide much
don't want add more, can say, hey, can get stronger without
getting bigger? boom, look towards powerlifting concepts. can get
powerful? can get faster don't, again, want lose fat? OK, great. want
physique changes. different areas can pick choose

mind all, included, arrived lopsided fitness, much
endurance, not enough strength, much strength, not enough endurance, really
hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

hard imagine anyone's perfect regard. Can walk us nine
different adaptations mentioned earlier give us way assess level
ability level adaptation nine? ANDY GALPIN: right.
first one want talk movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific.
not going give assessment optimal golf technique swing. really
human movement stay injury free can continue train
long possible. minimum requirements? Now, can access
highly-qualified physical therapist movement specialist, best route. Go
them. identify movement patterns, overhead pressing,
squatting, running, things. gold standard. want
yourself, though, simple four-step solution. way teach
go joint joint. think major ones, shoulder, elbow,
low back, hip, knee, ankle. Now, can representative movement
you. bench lot, use bench. pull-ups, use pull-up.
squat, that. recommend upper-body press, upper-body pull,
lower-body press, lower-body pull. example push-up, pull-up,
bent row, squat, deadlift. very, well-rounded
approach. going movement. record
yourself. record frontal view side view. Probably three 10 repetitions
per angle, slow controlled. don't need body weight. want
move, want look key things every joint. again, imagine
squat. going squat, going focus just ankle. going
look four things ankle. going go back watch knee
look four things knee hip, et cetera.


four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

four things? Number one want look symmetry. symmetry front
back, left right, right limb left limb. want look
aren't moving perfectly, fine. want see one moving
ahead one? one turning side one's not? one fidgeting
twitching around differently? want look just check, see make sure
stable. one. Number two, want look stability. key
indicators things can't get Squat, controlled squat,
knees don't start shaking. instability issue. can
movement slow? Can pause bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five
seconds 10? complete control movement
joints. hips sliding one side stand up? one elbow closer
body benching one's flared out? things
talking about. not worried angle not.
simply looking asymmetries instabilities. again, pushing up, one
elbow start flipping twitching going place? third one
call awareness. lot movement technique issues that, simply, people
don't know. watch squat. classes time.
100 kids there, squatting. see horrible squat technique.
just tell them, hey, realize heels supposed
ground times squat? like, oh, OK. can correct it. not
actually movement flaw. just simply awareness. didn't know,
actually didn't realize happening position. want joints
going general full range motion, number four. ankle--
squat, knees able go far toe possible
maintaining good position, feet flat floor, three points contact,
whole flat foot, not compromising another joint. going
look four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, range motion
joint, movement. sounds difficult time-consuming.
really not. can generally clear things one two repetitions couple
seconds. really going look for-- lots scoring schemes
can test, physical therapists will sort do. just look absolutely terrible, can't
all, minor flaw, pretty close good. really looking for. scoring
system zero, one, three. Zero like, not going exercise
high acute risk. might get hurt rep one tomorrow. Number one,


score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

score one like, minor flaw here. can probably it, need
cautious load volume. one is, maybe perfect, maybe not,
go ahead reasonable protocol. fine. generally


01:12:38 Speed Test, Power Test

need cost-free method identifying good movement technique within
things do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: speed? ANDY
GALPIN: actually don't think one people test. high-
performance athlete, can run 40-yard dash can different things
velocity transducer barbell, weightlifter something. people,
pure speed really maximum velocity acceleration two ways break
down. generally not necessary test. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
number three, power, believe told speed times force. ANDY
GALPIN: reason don't worry much speed can
infer lot power test. power test easier well easier
train people. cost-free version simple broad jump.
stand normal position, jump far front possibly can,
measure distance started back heel,
lands. super basic number look height. able
broad jump tall are. 5' 5," hit 5' 5," 6' 5," et cetera. not
perfect. going ratchet little bit, 15%, females. just simply
don't power, general, men have. going want bring
little bit, crude number. look high-
performance NFL player, six feet tall, going jumping nine 10
11 feet. can jump body height-- not looking optimization
particular test. looking red flags can jump body height,
going just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredibly straightforward yet,
one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: assuming
can squat low need jump, can swing arms back
front harder, much momentum can muster. land, said
going take measure back heels. ANDY GALPIN: want
measure distance actually covered. clarify, no running approach


here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

here. no steps it. going stand still. Yeah, can swing,
bounce much like do. going projectile off. going
measure distance tip toe-- basically, stand behind line
furthest point back land. basically, worst possible score, not
best possible feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going
little bit farther. Now, technically, fall backwards hand touches
ground, mark number, case, just use furthest point back
back heel, go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: trying tomorrow morning.
ANDY GALPIN: Now, access little bit technology just really
want know better number, classic vertical jump good starting place.
can actually simple, cost-free way. can just measure two hands.
Put together middle fingers touching. Overlap them,
put directly head. want reach high can get.
mark wall. brother used time.
take highlighter, yellow ones, color much fingertips,
touch wall highlighter stain wall-- actually go back
house childhood, see markers house. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: sure parents thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: dad didn't care.
Single dad, didn't care. just like, whatever, guys. whatever want.
want measure that. then, course, going jump two
hands touch high can up. going measure distance
standing reach actual height jumped there. Now,
reason two-handed way, one-handed, can
actually reach pretty high offsetting shoulders. now getting
differences shoulder mobility, ability get there. two-
handed standard approach there. thing, no running approach here. can dip.
can drive. can things. can swing arms, going
two-handed touch, general way that. want look number
something like 24 inches higher. past age 50, number can come
little bit, closer 20. again, females, going ratcheted
15% everywhere go. middle-aged female, jumping 20
inches, pretty good spot. going looking really nice there. Now,
can force plate, even better. are, basically, scales
will go multiple digits, sometimes five nine digits past zero. going


stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

stand things, going exact test.
interesting tell not high jump, tell
much force put ground. can also tell long took you--
called rate force development-- well impulse speed bunch
stuff, important help understand power spectrum
need be. addition using sort velocity
transducer barbell. classic thing be, say, going
squat. going put device barbell, going
measure speed barbell moves. going 40%
one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. allows
create called force-velocity curve. can start see point,
start loading things heavy, start slowing much. will tell
part force-velocity curve want train optimize power.
important, lot people will things like, training power,
heavy lift? Well, general answer people say is, 30% one-rep max,
actually not true all. optimal power development--
discuss much later-- depending flawed force-velocity
curve. access technology like that, can give lot insight
information. not, broad jump test highlighter fingertips
jump touch wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andy Galpin's house.
ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along.

01:18:42 Strength Test

walls already messed up. Just go ahead come Washington,
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right.
strength really important. need measure multiple areas.
start off grip strength. can two ways. can buy hand grip
dynamometer. Now, anywhere $20 $100, anywhere.
actually used be, school, hundreds dollars. now can literally
buy website $25. honest recommendation technically,
not cost-free. know whole thing cost-free protocols, $25, calling
basically cost-free. can bring test that. just little device
going squeeze, going it. right hand


left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

left hand. want look asymmetries there, want look
something like-- typically, going give value kilograms. want
look something like minimum score 40 kilograms. Ideally, past 60
really good spot in. want make sure no less
10% variation left right hand. non-dominant hand actually
shouldn't much weaker test. actually see, lot times,
non-dominant can oftentimes stronger dominant hand
movement precision, writing, things like that. want close.
male 40 kilograms hand grip dynamometer, going need
train that. female, not much lower, 35 kilograms
cutoff point. 55, can add training, not worried
leaving training. female, 50, cut off
want go. fairly cheap one. Another one can actually just
dead hang. can hold bar, ideally, one thin enough
can wrap whole hand around it. don't want using giant fat grip.
going false reading here. something like going gym
jumping pull-up bar pull-up rack. want hang, simple
time test. general, able hang minimum 30 seconds
looking for. 30 50 seconds good, probably get better here.
cruising 60 seconds, generally pretty happy. actually good
example females tend better. Grip strength women tends strong,
can hang quite long time. standards don't really change
much women. Now, exceptionally large, thing doesn't scale perfectly.
240 pounds even lean, just hard hang hold 240 pounds.
Conversely, 145 pounds, even unhealthy, going able
hang long time. just not much weight carry. just rough numbers
start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: grip strength. strength
elsewhere body? ANDY GALPIN: primary ones, can upper body
strength test like, although not technically something often.
happy one max bench press something like that. great.
generally interested leg extension test. reason like is, back
squat better. barbell back squat is-- look, jam. life. just
technically demanding, challenging. need spotters. need comfort. lot
goes this. average person, leg extension test fairly standardized.


don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

don't worry technique, people can just get go.
want look couple standards want hit. Again, simple
answer body weight. Can leg extension body weight?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: can answer right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. can hack
squat reasonable amount weight, leg extension morning,
Nautilus machine. certainly not leg extension body weight. ANDY
GALPIN: Let clarify. single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
ANDY GALPIN: bilateral, can't leg extension body weight? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No. certainly can hamstring curl body weight. ANDY GALPIN:
OK. maybe deficiencies quads need go after,
pretty good number want at. go age past age 40, every
decade can come 10%, still pretty good slot.
50 years old 170 pounds, can 160, pretty good
spot. just, again, take 10% every decade 40,
prior 40, really no change strength, certainly, somebody 40s
50s able leg extension body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.
look forward discussion bit later, talking build strength. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. strength tests, don't done technical
true one-rep max. can use called repetition conversion equation. put
load think kind close maximum just many reps
can. long five reps total, can actually go online enter
number calculators anywhere, will tell you, OK, three
repetitions 200 pounds. one-rep max probably 215, whatever.
estimate equation. don't want spend time not truly comfortable
absolutely going true one-rep max, just get number fairly close
many can go line, again, one-rep max estimator equations
everywhere. get past five repetitions so, accuracy equations starts
going down. don't put something go, oh, 12 reps try
figure one-rep max. It'll get close. start moving past that, just getting
worse worse worse accuracy. want make sure whether
leg extension test front squat test, don't technically absolute
one-rep max. neither option, another one like lot simply


front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

front squat goblet squat hold. going hold weight front chest.
kettlebell great here. dumbbell fine here. want hold half
body weight, go way bottom position, try hold 45
seconds. pretty good indicator number one, position. hard
bad position long load well core strength low back stability.
different indicator than, say, leg extension test, really nice one.
doesn't require many moving parts. difficult leg extension, quite
bit functional. going give insights lot areas just
quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 45 seconds bottom squat
returning standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can't
return, actually, not worried, long can hold good position
without technical breakdown 45 seconds, really good spot. intro,
want third body weight 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. plan
attempt strength tests soon. hypertrophy? ANDY
GALPIN: Sure. Actually, get that, want jump back really quickly.
important add couple caveats strength training stuff. two
want do. Number one, assuming technically proficient. don't
want exercise exhaustion maximum strength not
comfortable technique. adjust accordingly. not comfortable
front squat, leg extension. uncomfortable that, something
different. never want utilize maximum testing going come
consequence serious acute injury. important flag. second one
is, warm-up protocol will huge effect actual results.
whenever tests, especially going test test
line, want make sure warm-up protocol standardized. Now,
again, NFCA-- can give resources-- specific guides exactly
warm-up protocol prior one-rep max testing. can go there,
can look stuff up. can add show notes something. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. think get deeper discussion strength
hypertrophy resistance training general, maybe touch best
warm-up protocol. know mine, certain going suboptimal based
everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe causing problems. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --based every conversation ever had, learned
things incorrectly. make changes basis tell me.


ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

ANDY GALPIN: not incorrectly much suboptimal.

01:27:16 Hypertrophy Test

ANDREW HUBERMAN: kind way telling incorrect. Thank you.
hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: thing want pay attention
is, aesthetic portion hypertrophy. entirely you. no
rationale. can decide feel like looks good doesn't look good.
irrelevant. sufficient amount need have, that,
detrimental health, regardless outcomes. best way
couple ways. sort body composition tests can this. whether
scan like DEXA scan, gold standard ways biological,
bioelectrical impedance otherwise. ton different tests can get
pretty close. want pay attention get DEXA scan
number called FFFMI. stands "fat-free mass index." can look
again, number online calculators. standard, doesn't actually
matter pull up. don't worry looking whether
not right not something. going actually tell
sufficient muscle mass. number want look for, general, something
like man, FFMI something like 20 higher. woman,
want look something like 18. targets. get past 24, 25
man, lot muscle mass, assuming reasonably lean. Now,
FFMI like 24, 25 body fat 40%, actually just very, large
individual. not great spot. say sort numbers,
assumption probably sub 30% body fat man sub 35% woman.
numbers. online calculators. really need know
total body weight, body fat percentage, height. can
enter three numbers, tell FFMI score, it'll correct
adjusted value. will actually tell grading rubric
say, good, average, bad, et cetera, numbers look at.
are, man, sub 17, woman, sub 15, now area pretty severe
physiological detriment insufficient muscle. later discussions,
talk matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not sub 17% body fat.



01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work

personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing

walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing

Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart

think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize

squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning

right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

01:29:38 Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up

says specifically, FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: correct, yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: muscular endurance? going tell
need wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: really nice. can number
tests here. standard plank good test muscle endurance. can hold
front plank 60 seconds? Can hold side plank 45 seconds? Pretty easy.
able push-up. can't, sort tells alone. actually
interesting. can't single push-up, not muscular endurance issue.
actually now strength issue one-rep max problem. want
able to-- again, general male, no problem 25 plus
consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: apologize interrupting you,
long talking push-ups, just mention form? talking chest
touching ground? Elbows breaking right angles? proper push-up,
according laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless specific reason
limit range motion, want testing done full joint range motion.
different person. individualized them, general, push-up,
full complete lockout elbows top full chest touch
close ground. can different. doesn't really matter, just keep
standard pretest post-test trying mark progress, us,
unless specific reason, going full range motion
tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. 25 push-ups male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-
ups male standard. even something like 10 number looking
for, again, minimum categories upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: not get weeds, observed people--
course, never myself. No, kidding-- observed people pausing maybe
repetition 15, catching breath continuing. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: continue like piston. ANDY GALPIN:
fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Just down, down, trying hit least 10, ideally 25. ANDY
GALPIN: learned lesson one studies, probably nine years ago,
didn't clarify that. actually individual-- wasn't nefarious.
just figured out, couple, take quick break couple, quadrupled
post-test results pre-test result figured little hack.


want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually

make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited

ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not

want standardize it. not sort strong belief. just
trying keep protocol standardized, means break, failed test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: 10 25 push-ups, minimum, males. females?
ANDY GALPIN: clarify. sub 10 man, again, like,
severe red flag problem. really, really like see number 25.
anchoring. Anything 10 25 like, yeah, not severe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: means work do. ANDY GALPIN: work do.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: females? ANDY GALPIN: female, going
scale back. female, answer little zero. going
see that, can full position? position, generally not going
muscular endurance test knees. already know answer
zero. actually default another test, talk second here.
folks, going scale little bit. basically, looking 15
marker, like 25 male, want see 15. do, good.
Anything five 15 number of, OK. sub five, generally
problems. different, one zero, zero problem.
able that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: female cannot 10
full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard female, depending
size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. say female can't five full push-ups.
said, rather go knees-down version, assess
muscular endurance? also encourage work
strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. again, can't do-- can
anything less three, going strength. fact, want look
muscular endurance general-- bit off topic, promise keep
short, come right back. doctoral student, two lab mates. One
runner, female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. one
male, basically like straight bro, lifts weights, doesn't
sort training. classic not training program, kind training.
bantering back forth while. basically saying,
unfit. can't run all. saying, weak. can't pull-up.
challenged competition. said, end year, girl
going 26 pull-ups, guy run marathon, 26 miles.
thing. sort consequence whoever failed. guy
quickly tried figure out, hell going run 26 miles not run


mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

mile many, many, many years? just started running, three miles, four miles,
whatever. Well, course, ran immediately me. like,
hell? can't pull-up. like, great. gave specific
maximal strength protocol. like, whoa. want go assisted pull-up
machine work sets 25 got get muscular endurance
up. tried explain her, muscle endurance irrelevant can't one.
never going matter. muscular endurance protocol, entire thing.
Didn't listen me. end year came. still produced exactly zero pull-ups.
point is, look muscular endurance, strength
actually muscular endurance? general number looking 80%.
going tell you, muscular endurance problem absolute
strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80% one-repetition maximum?
ANDY GALPIN: Yup. mean this. fact, actually
question. way assess muscular endurance take exact strength tests
talk five minutes ago, one do? Load 75%,
many repetitions can. tremendous barometer
muscular endurance. able 200 pounds leg extension test,
put 75% many reps can. want look
eight repetitions. eight repetitions, muscular endurance
problem. higher that, got 15 20, know probably
problems peak strength test itself.

01:36:23 Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate

good-- eight 12 number want looking there.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: one's
challenging. either go laboratory something like Wingate
Test. 30-second maximal test going see much work can
possibly 30 seconds. don't access laboratory, can
protocol want. sprinting. can air bike.
rower, anything like that, anything can exert maximal effort
don't worry technical problems. generally don't like things
like kettlebell swing something like that. just many variables.
need able go hard possibly can, knowing going get


place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

place tremendous fatigue. Now, lab, often use called Bosco
Protocol. going stand force plate, going many
vertical jumps fast can, high can, 60 seconds.
absolutely destroyed second 45. either use Wingate Protocol
Bosco Protocol. want, though, again, take places, 30 seconds
so, 45 seconds, minute want, doesn't really matter. just
mark distance cover. all. don't really standards
things going different. far can travel 30 seconds
treadmill just going different sprinting field assault bike
whatever. really want worry is, can complete it?
awful feel afterwards? really want think
not protocols, this. want think can get close predicted
maximum heart rate? number throw 220 minus age. 50
years old, 220 minus 50, able get maximum heart rate around
170 beats per minute. Now, number extremely generic. don't get there,
doesn't indication fitness. get higher, doesn't mean
fit. just rough number. want do. case,
heart rate recovery better metric. want get maximum heart rate
test heart rate recovery. looking
half beat recovery per second. going get place reach
absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test heart rate, count.
timer going. Within 60 seconds, have, again, half beat per
second. heart rate recovery 30 beats per minute. Within next
minute, two-minute recovery, be, again, half that, 60 beats.
rough numbers go by. three-minute recovery is, again, half again.
closest way. heart rate recovery worse that, know
problem anaerobic capacity

01:39:29 Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max

cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. number
eight, maximal heart rate? just described sounds lot like maximal
heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: VO2 max. gold standard
actually go laboratory get thing done. can actually run VO2 max


test, put mask on, collect gases, run there.
specific protocol completion true maximum test. scientist will
know that. don't access that, can couple tests. One
called 12-Minute Cooper's Test. simply time. going run 12
minutes far can, going record distance covered. Again,
can go online number calculators, enter distance in. will tell
proximal estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 12-minute
sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance can cover 12
minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping steady pace whole time going--
ANDY GALPIN: whatever want. goal get maximum distance covered
12 minutes. anywhere mile two plus miles, depending fit
are, just Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
ANDY GALPIN: told you. remember, aerobic capacity eight 12 minutes
going see real true test VO2 max. simply can't get
minutes. want, can little gentler version that.
number submaximal tests. fact, one-mile walk test can do.
again, going is-- case, either stopwatch or,
ideally, heart rate monitor. is-- walk one mile
submaximal test. going walk mile, record time, record heart rate
end, enter in. will give you, again, estimates VO2 max.
like, oh gosh, can't run 12 minutes hard possibly can don't
want it. lot executive program. like, knee hurts
bad. got back pain run whatever. Can I-- OK. walk test.
pretty accurate correctly. technically, actually
measure heart rate neck count 60 seconds, just easier to--
everyone's watches stuff now, just wear heart rate monitor, plug
numbers. again, standard calculations. anywhere find those,
don't worry source. just enter stuff in,
going running off equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like idea
12-minute run. going give shot, see happens. ANDY GALPIN: years,
one-mile version this, just lot science 12-Minute
Cooper Test. that. pretty good, not even remotely close fun.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: sounds like fun reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
yeah. Well, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun sense reveals lot. ANDY


GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear
arrange performance different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: instance, separate one test, like long-duration
output one day strength another day? seem pretty obvious
me, ones one can combine different days? much time
one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start

not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back

one give oneself tests? often one assessment?
Just don't want necessarily evaluate body weight changes getting


scale three times day, maybe day time day practical.
often assessing fitness every one these? ANDY
GALPIN: Well, way say is, want pick one worst
frequently. if, example, upper body strength test
fantastic, can bench press double body weight, don't need test
bench often, average person. not powerlifter, maybe
year something. Maybe not even that. just don't need get there. However,
test VO2 max 12 minutes, cover total half mile,
might want test every month. going let priorities
emphasize one going often. recommend full
battery year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning entire list one
day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not one day, within week. take week.
Now, these, technically, two days. Three-day split probably
best. just say, hey, testing week. actually love beginning
year whenever change training, think year, just
like year probably go physician get full bloodwork, full heart
scan everything like that. maybe heart issue, come
back test frequently, whatever case is. probably run
this. going thinking, yeah, don't want give
exercise routine week. Well, promise you, not going finish week
think, didn't much work week. going feel great. going
nice barometer exactly need change prioritize
training next quarter half year wherever want go. want
actually every six months, end up, actually, this, quite honestly,
like every six months general test. really good way it, minimum,
arguing me, give year want this. order
in? non-fatiguing tests, can whenever. body
composition scan, FFMI, body fat composition. stuff can done
whenever. generally like that, though, first activity. reason
know acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition
measurements inflammation, water storage, et cetera. easiest just
get off 48 hour rest. want make sure don't hard exercise
day body composition test probably 48 hours that. just start
off that. movement tests can thing. don't want try


assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,



01:52:44 VO2 Max Measurements

longevity, clear nine going important regard
another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
volume oxygen per size time duration. fact, way calculate
multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,
hypertrophy

GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super.
no hiding. can hide leg extension test. doesn't hurt bad.
cannot feel anything 12-minute "run far can" test. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests--

01:42:42 Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test

ANDY GALPIN: are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of sort. ANDY GALPIN: sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. think
a.k.a. endurance, mentioned before, forms
endurance. long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. really
want think not standard number. maintain consistent work
output 20 plus minutes. one want just pick something
lifestyle. loop around house can do?
protocol like use before? simply going test ability.
Can maintain work without stopping? needs be. Now ideally,
personally like throw little twist here, is, can nasal breathing
only. feel really good. can go 30 straight minutes without needing
take break-- walking doesn't really cut unless very, unfit, case,
walking 30 minutes without break challenge, OK. There. can, want
moving non-walking pace. don't care zone is, two, three, four, five. don't
care. Show can maintain minimum 20 minutes work

01:44:00 Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order

no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing
nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love list, worries bit. Not
one tests necessarily overwhelming, unclear

multiply cardiac output called a-vO2 difference. cardiac
output heart rate times stroke volume, much blood pumping
per pump stroke volume. many times pumping beating.
multiply a-vO2 difference. a-vO2 difference artery minus vein
difference. amount oxygen arteries minus amount oxygen
vein, going tell much took capillaries,
muscles. take two factors, multiply together, VO2
max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: describing that, imagine getting
fMRI machine seeing equation lighting brain clearly,
committed memory well. Thank clear description. ANDY GALPIN:
Yeah. finish numbers, really, truly want see man 50--
not even really stoked get 55. fact, sort funny. Dave Costill, whose
lab PhD in-- retired time, he's, again, one legendary
figures exercise physiology, started '70s. always say, "There's no
human excuse 60," always like, damn. really, actually,
pretty hard get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 60 above? ANDY GALPIN:
Oh, yeah. still, actually, setting world records last couple years,
Masters records swimming cycling stuff. super, super fit guy.
always 60. probably like 50 something now, even though 80
whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW


HUBERMAN: VO2 max 50. ANDY GALPIN: probably really not 50.
probably-- probably going to-- remember earlier talked
92-year-old VO2 max 38. Dave's probably going break record
gets there, sure. sure. fact, guarantee number
brain. haven't talked 15 years, guarantee number brain,
probably training it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. love
proves exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one things life direct relationship work
outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Henry Rollins described wonderful essay,
familiar that. Oh gosh, punk rock guy. know Henry, sure.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean, certainly know is, know work. ANDY
GALPIN: Yeah. incredible one-page paper. something iron.
basically describes as, one thing truth. true
thing ever do, love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost like principle
nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. women, really want see
women-- want see men 55, really want see women 50
target. like, there, pretty good. can math on, then,
middle ground like OK, need work it. fact, look across
literature, different athletes, going see really high-level endurance folks,
may pass 70 80. fact, talk years ago guy breaking 100
18 19-year-old, actually don't think ever fully confirmed repeated,
certainly, see plenty people 95, extremes. look sports,
like football basketball, probably going 55, 65 range. you, as,
average person 55, really good marker in. get even close
that, good spot. sorry let down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
just love describing average person, looking just
little bit sympathy, like reach standard average, Andrew. Listen,
giving prompts place try improve metrics, whatever
happen be. think one great values getting objective numbers,
even measured back-of-the-envelope techniques
that, guess, always teach people laboratory, tool can not extremely
precise, long reliable, still value there. mean, course, love
precise reliable tool, can't, least go
reliable tool measure consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. real world,


reliability beats validity much can. lot things talking about,
especially using metric get better, long tool reliable. Body
composition, just things inherent error them.
smaller, larger, mentioned, standardization within
testing protocol going allow

01:58:04 Protocols 9 Adaptations

measure progress. going tell sort at. Now
covered areas adaptation, walked history,
walked bunch explanations people maybe not getting
results want get training, way like go rest
conversations just go adaptations step step
make sure cover specific protocols for, run testing
identified area weakness. maybe lifting lot like
lifting, maybe realize cardiovascular fitness heart rate recovery
not really opposite, like talked about. Maybe
lot type work, strength isn't there. movement quality
not there. identified problem. specifically solve it?
evidence-based effective protocols can put one
categories? think give people lot take-home value,
going take us time cover. going come across multiple
conversations I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, looking
forward conversations. want add just one metric
discussion today, really just way saying thank
metric amount useful information per sentence spoke,
upper level metric. amazing ability provide much knowledge
clear concise and, today, listed-out format interesting, grounded
science, actionable. behalf everyone listening, certainly
well, just want say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, appreciate compliments.
looking forward next conversation, jumping right speed, strength,

assessment well squatting incredibly sore brutal
squatting test. tend things fresh.
want skill maximum strength power goes beginning
day. fatiguing thing happens end. easily this.
right, going power test, broad jump, great. not going
fatigued that. day, since already pretty warmed up, now
going roll right leg strength test. since really warmed up, going
leg muscular endurance test right there. common strategy
use. one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever
need do, come back, load 75%, many reps can. Boom.
roll right into, then, upper body test grip strength test anything else
want there. little bit influence? Yeah, really, people,
not bad. influence mean. leg strength test, coming back
upper body strength test afterwards, not big deal. Give 15,
give 20 minutes. Give plenty time. can knock strength
testing muscular endurance testing one day. performance,
skill diagnostic, power jump test, strength, muscular endurance,
stuff knocked out. going come back separate day
anaerobic tests. 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that.
could, though, wanted, long duration tests. long
duration test again, just going function big, warm up. flip
things can separate days. going VO2 max
test day, part, unless wanted do, again, movement
body composition things. really ability mix
match. Ideally, realistically probably takes three days. want separate
four five, separation do, better data going get.
just question pedantic really trying get here? willing
lose 5% save whole day? can things multiple stacks.
break up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: hearing is, better
not it. ANDY GALPIN: definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
rational. Don't try strength output late day fatigued.
going combine steady state endurance maximal heart rate,
fine. Understand might slight deficit there, test way time.
really looking improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. can


also heart rate recovery modalities. heart
rate recovery VO2 max well. finish thing, just, again,
test three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fantastic
tools. almost tempted say willing post numbers, actually
violates core principle think getting here, highly
unlikely anybody going phenomenal across board. mean, certainly
will individuals are, based everything talked earlier,
specificity training extensively somebody training certain way will,
without question, lop side them, will, toward better
assessments less good others. just simply way
adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. don't need optimal
areas be, quote, unquote, "optimal health" perspective. just want
make sure, again, no severe performance anchors. call them.
don't want severe constraints going get limited
thing. want move just sufficient concerning
get away that. that, thing's not going catch you. going
able continue pursue optimization one things
specific passion for, generally moves people. train feel
better. train know benefits it. jeez,
audience probably list hundreds them. also train generally
like get better something. lot us something. want make
sure not going, hey, know good endurance, really shouldn't
train anymore. don't want message, not all. want love training.
just want make sure not loving much not taking
blinders off missing another area, actually-- again, pull
performance anchor, whole ship sails faster, less effort less friction.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: love also that, described it, not
just athletes people super fitness. also people just want
healthy want aesthetic changes. exercising, which, think,
accounts fairly large percentage people there. think described
incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, incredibly actionable. want
thank serious willingness least share
numbers you. think people seeking listed off
aesthetic changes, functionality,

another. ANDY GALPIN: close out, want go back finish off
metrics VO2 max don't actually think gave numbers that.
general, men, minimum number want look 35 milliliters per kilogram
per minute. women, 30. can actually push lot higher
things. reality, want see men 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just interrupt second. say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters
what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. what, actually, metrics mean
first one, milliliters, oxygen. amount oxygen. Kilograms body weight.
it's, much oxygen can bring per kilogram body weight per minute?
