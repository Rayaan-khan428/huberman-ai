first sponsor Levels. Levels program helps see different foods affect
health giving real-time feedback diet using continuous glucose
monitor. started using Levels one year ago. Levels monitor allowed
see different foods change blood sugar level blood glucose level.
turns immensely important able predict how, instance, certain
foods will affect energy level, ability exercise, ability recover
exercise, will affect hormones like testosterone, estrogen, thyroid
hormone, forth. thing using Levels monitor gave
insight food exercise activities even well sleeping
poorly might happen sleeping impact blood glucose levels. even
taught sauna, generating lot heat body, changing
blood glucose levels, turned inform shift eating patterns,
foods eat, timing eat, forth. really gave great insight

00:07:19 Neuroplasticity, Learning Speech & Environmental Sounds



Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Eddie
Chang. Eddie, welcome. - Hi. Hi, Andrew. - Great you.
long time coming. Just come clean, known since nine years
old. - Yeah. - long gap didn't talk one another.
heard things you, and, presumably, heard thing two me, better
worse. [Eddie laughs] reconnected years later PhD
student medical student. literally ran halls
University California San Francisco now chair neurosurgery,
comes full circle. UCSF, working Mike
Merzenich, know name might not familiar lot people, sort
synonymous neuroplasticity, ability brain nervous system change
response experience. listeners, just love give brief
overview time find work fascinating,
really points things can promote maybe hinder brain's
ability change. - Oh, wow. fantastic. bump
serendipitously back then, and, time, medical student UCSF studying
Mike Merzenich. particular, studying brain organizes
patterns sound. particular, studying brain rodents
trying understand different sound patterns organize frequency representation
low middle high frequency maps brains baby rodents. one
things interested trying understand patterns
natural environment, say vocalizations environment rat pups
raised in, just natural sounds hear, shapes structure
brain. one things try experiment raised
rat pups white noise, continuous white noise essentially masking
environmental sounds. - consequence animals raised
white noise environment? - Well, one things didn't expect found,
quite striking, early period brain development
susceptible patterns hear see. neuroscience, call
critical period sensitive period. eyes, also
ears. one striking examples human can essentially
grow culture hear different speech sounds one language
another, like couple years, lose sensitivity sounds not
part native language high sensitivity languages


native culture. pretty extraordinary human brain flexibility yet,
time, specialization language. trying think
model this, example, rodents, obviously don't speak, just
understanding sounds environmental sounds modulate organize
auditory cortex. one things found quite striking
basically mask environmental sounds rat pups, critical period,
sensitive period open plasticity, open change, open
reorganization, window can stay open much, much longer. one way,
sounds like good thing, hand, also retardation. actually
slowed maturation auditory cortex. ready close rat pups
really young, raising white noise, found keep
open months beyond time period normally closes. think one
things taught not just genetic programming specifies
sensitive period, also little bit nature sounds
hear help keep window critical period open closed. -
fascinating. know difficult make direct leap animal research human
research, speculate little bit, can imagine people grow
homes lot shouting lot inflection, maybe people
verbose. Maybe others grow home quieter peaceful.
people going grow cities. just came back New York City, like
night long, honking sirens just nonstop, return
quite quiet night. Can imagine human brain going shaped
differently depending whether not one grows one environment another?
impact tendency speak certain way well hear
certain way? know that? - Well, think that, perspective,
really clear sounds exposed earliest time, even
utero, womb, sound hearing mother father friends
womb actually will influence things organize. no question
sounds hear going influence, sounds
going structure way neural networks actually lay will forever
influence hear sounds,

00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization



speech language probably one profound examples that. - get
lot questions use white noise sleep. particular, people want
know whether not using white noise machine machine program makes
sound waves, instance, assists infant sleeping, going bad
flooding auditory system bunch essentially white noise
disorganized noise? answer question? - Not yet. think
asking really important question parents using white noise
generators almost universally now, good reasons. know, hard
kids night. got three kids tempted think
use tools just soothe get bed, especially
was, like, tired exhausted. think cost, know, think
little bit about. know, not exposed continuous white noise naturally.
value really salient, structured sounds part natural
environment actually brain develop normally. whether not
impact, know, sleeping, not clear. don't think studies
done. really clear raise baby rats
continuous white noise, not super loud, just enough mask environmental
sounds enough keep, know, auditory cortex, part brain
hears, really delayed state essentially slow
development maturation brain. - one probably assume slowing
maturation areas brain responsible hearing might, want
underscore, might impact one's ability speak, right? isn't case
people can't hear, actually harder time enunciating particular way,
right? not able hear voice, speech patterns
change? - Well, think part that, time, develop sensitivity
specific speech sounds given language, sensitivity improves hear
it. hand, lose sensitivity
speech sounds time. part process, also selectivity,
gain, specialization even sounds, even relative noise, noisy backgrounds
things like that. tend think like signal-to-noise ratio?
brain ways trying increase signal-to-noise ratio order make
clear. Part hear lays foundation
signal-to-noise ratio, can imagine child raised continuously white
noise really deprived kind sounds really necessary


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact

doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-

tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really

started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train

example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort

supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

00:07:19 Neuroplasticity, Learning Speech & Environmental Sounds



Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Eddie
Chang. Eddie, welcome. - Hi. Hi, Andrew. - Great you.
long time coming. Just come clean, known since nine years
old. - Yeah. - long gap didn't talk one another.
heard things you, and, presumably, heard thing two me, better
worse. [Eddie laughs] reconnected years later PhD
student medical student. literally ran halls
University California San Francisco now chair neurosurgery,
comes full circle. UCSF, working Mike
Merzenich, know name might not familiar lot people, sort
synonymous neuroplasticity, ability brain nervous system change
response experience. listeners, just love give brief
overview time find work fascinating,
really points things can promote maybe hinder brain's
ability change. - Oh, wow. fantastic. bump
serendipitously back then, and, time, medical student UCSF studying
Mike Merzenich. particular, studying brain organizes
patterns sound. particular, studying brain rodents
trying understand different sound patterns organize frequency representation
low middle high frequency maps brains baby rodents. one
things interested trying understand patterns
natural environment, say vocalizations environment rat pups
raised in, just natural sounds hear, shapes structure
brain. one things try experiment raised
rat pups white noise, continuous white noise essentially masking
environmental sounds. - consequence animals raised
white noise environment? - Well, one things didn't expect found,
quite striking, early period brain development
susceptible patterns hear see. neuroscience, call
critical period sensitive period. eyes, also
ears. one striking examples human can essentially
grow culture hear different speech sounds one language
another, like couple years, lose sensitivity sounds not
part native language high sensitivity languages


native culture. pretty extraordinary human brain flexibility yet,
time, specialization language. trying think
model this, example, rodents, obviously don't speak, just
understanding sounds environmental sounds modulate organize
auditory cortex. one things found quite striking
basically mask environmental sounds rat pups, critical period,
sensitive period open plasticity, open change, open
reorganization, window can stay open much, much longer. one way,
sounds like good thing, hand, also retardation. actually
slowed maturation auditory cortex. ready close rat pups
really young, raising white noise, found keep
open months beyond time period normally closes. think one
things taught not just genetic programming specifies
sensitive period, also little bit nature sounds
hear help keep window critical period open closed. -
fascinating. know difficult make direct leap animal research human
research, speculate little bit, can imagine people grow
homes lot shouting lot inflection, maybe people
verbose. Maybe others grow home quieter peaceful.
people going grow cities. just came back New York City, like
night long, honking sirens just nonstop, return
quite quiet night. Can imagine human brain going shaped
differently depending whether not one grows one environment another?
impact tendency speak certain way well hear
certain way? know that? - Well, think that, perspective,
really clear sounds exposed earliest time, even
utero, womb, sound hearing mother father friends
womb actually will influence things organize. no question
sounds hear going influence, sounds
going structure way neural networks actually lay will forever
influence hear sounds,

00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization



speech language probably one profound examples that. - get
lot questions use white noise sleep. particular, people want
know whether not using white noise machine machine program makes
sound waves, instance, assists infant sleeping, going bad
flooding auditory system bunch essentially white noise
disorganized noise? answer question? - Not yet. think
asking really important question parents using white noise
generators almost universally now, good reasons. know, hard
kids night. got three kids tempted think
use tools just soothe get bed, especially
was, like, tired exhausted. think cost, know, think
little bit about. know, not exposed continuous white noise naturally.
value really salient, structured sounds part natural
environment actually brain develop normally. whether not
impact, know, sleeping, not clear. don't think studies
done. really clear raise baby rats
continuous white noise, not super loud, just enough mask environmental
sounds enough keep, know, auditory cortex, part brain
hears, really delayed state essentially slow
development maturation brain. - one probably assume slowing
maturation areas brain responsible hearing might, want
underscore, might impact one's ability speak, right? isn't case
people can't hear, actually harder time enunciating particular way,
right? not able hear voice, speech patterns
change? - Well, think part that, time, develop sensitivity
specific speech sounds given language, sensitivity improves hear
it. hand, lose sensitivity
speech sounds time. part process, also selectivity,
gain, specialization even sounds, even relative noise, noisy backgrounds
things like that. tend think like signal-to-noise ratio?
brain ways trying increase signal-to-noise ratio order make
clear. Part hear lays foundation
signal-to-noise ratio, can imagine child raised continuously white
noise really deprived kind sounds really necessary


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Eddie
Chang. Eddie, welcome. - Hi. Hi, Andrew. - Great you.
long time coming. Just come clean, known since nine years
old. - Yeah. - long gap didn't talk one another.
heard things you, and, presumably, heard thing two me, better
worse. [Eddie laughs] reconnected years later PhD
student medical student. literally ran halls
University California San Francisco now chair neurosurgery,
comes full circle. UCSF, working Mike
Merzenich, know name might not familiar lot people, sort
synonymous neuroplasticity, ability brain nervous system change
response experience. listeners, just love give brief
overview time find work fascinating,
really points things can promote maybe hinder brain's
ability change. - Oh, wow. fantastic. bump
serendipitously back then, and, time, medical student UCSF studying
Mike Merzenich. particular, studying brain organizes
patterns sound. particular, studying brain rodents
trying understand different sound patterns organize frequency representation
low middle high frequency maps brains baby rodents. one
things interested trying understand patterns
natural environment, say vocalizations environment rat pups
raised in, just natural sounds hear, shapes structure
brain. one things try experiment raised
rat pups white noise, continuous white noise essentially masking
environmental sounds. - consequence animals raised
white noise environment? - Well, one things didn't expect found,
quite striking, early period brain development
susceptible patterns hear see. neuroscience, call
critical period sensitive period. eyes, also
ears. one striking examples human can essentially
grow culture hear different speech sounds one language
another, like couple years, lose sensitivity sounds not
part native language high sensitivity languages


native culture. pretty extraordinary human brain flexibility yet,
time, specialization language. trying think
model this, example, rodents, obviously don't speak, just
understanding sounds environmental sounds modulate organize
auditory cortex. one things found quite striking
basically mask environmental sounds rat pups, critical period,
sensitive period open plasticity, open change, open
reorganization, window can stay open much, much longer. one way,
sounds like good thing, hand, also retardation. actually
slowed maturation auditory cortex. ready close rat pups
really young, raising white noise, found keep
open months beyond time period normally closes. think one
things taught not just genetic programming specifies
sensitive period, also little bit nature sounds
hear help keep window critical period open closed. -
fascinating. know difficult make direct leap animal research human
research, speculate little bit, can imagine people grow
homes lot shouting lot inflection, maybe people
verbose. Maybe others grow home quieter peaceful.
people going grow cities. just came back New York City, like
night long, honking sirens just nonstop, return
quite quiet night. Can imagine human brain going shaped
differently depending whether not one grows one environment another?
impact tendency speak certain way well hear
certain way? know that? - Well, think that, perspective,
really clear sounds exposed earliest time, even
utero, womb, sound hearing mother father friends
womb actually will influence things organize. no question
sounds hear going influence, sounds
going structure way neural networks actually lay will forever
influence hear sounds,

00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization



speech language probably one profound examples that. - get
lot questions use white noise sleep. particular, people want
know whether not using white noise machine machine program makes
sound waves, instance, assists infant sleeping, going bad
flooding auditory system bunch essentially white noise
disorganized noise? answer question? - Not yet. think
asking really important question parents using white noise
generators almost universally now, good reasons. know, hard
kids night. got three kids tempted think
use tools just soothe get bed, especially
was, like, tired exhausted. think cost, know, think
little bit about. know, not exposed continuous white noise naturally.
value really salient, structured sounds part natural
environment actually brain develop normally. whether not
impact, know, sleeping, not clear. don't think studies
done. really clear raise baby rats
continuous white noise, not super loud, just enough mask environmental
sounds enough keep, know, auditory cortex, part brain
hears, really delayed state essentially slow
development maturation brain. - one probably assume slowing
maturation areas brain responsible hearing might, want
underscore, might impact one's ability speak, right? isn't case
people can't hear, actually harder time enunciating particular way,
right? not able hear voice, speech patterns
change? - Well, think part that, time, develop sensitivity
specific speech sounds given language, sensitivity improves hear
it. hand, lose sensitivity
speech sounds time. part process, also selectivity,
gain, specialization even sounds, even relative noise, noisy backgrounds
things like that. tend think like signal-to-noise ratio?
brain ways trying increase signal-to-noise ratio order make
clear. Part hear lays foundation
signal-to-noise ratio, can imagine child raised continuously white
noise really deprived kind sounds really necessary


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train

example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


native culture. pretty extraordinary human brain flexibility yet,
time, specialization language. trying think
model this, example, rodents, obviously don't speak, just
understanding sounds environmental sounds modulate organize
auditory cortex. one things found quite striking
basically mask environmental sounds rat pups, critical period,
sensitive period open plasticity, open change, open
reorganization, window can stay open much, much longer. one way,
sounds like good thing, hand, also retardation. actually
slowed maturation auditory cortex. ready close rat pups
really young, raising white noise, found keep
open months beyond time period normally closes. think one
things taught not just genetic programming specifies
sensitive period, also little bit nature sounds
hear help keep window critical period open closed. -
fascinating. know difficult make direct leap animal research human
research, speculate little bit, can imagine people grow
homes lot shouting lot inflection, maybe people
verbose. Maybe others grow home quieter peaceful.
people going grow cities. just came back New York City, like
night long, honking sirens just nonstop, return
quite quiet night. Can imagine human brain going shaped
differently depending whether not one grows one environment another?
impact tendency speak certain way well hear
certain way? know that? - Well, think that, perspective,
really clear sounds exposed earliest time, even
utero, womb, sound hearing mother father friends
womb actually will influence things organize. no question
sounds hear going influence, sounds
going structure way neural networks actually lay will forever
influence hear sounds,

00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization



speech language probably one profound examples that. - get
lot questions use white noise sleep. particular, people want
know whether not using white noise machine machine program makes
sound waves, instance, assists infant sleeping, going bad
flooding auditory system bunch essentially white noise
disorganized noise? answer question? - Not yet. think
asking really important question parents using white noise
generators almost universally now, good reasons. know, hard
kids night. got three kids tempted think
use tools just soothe get bed, especially
was, like, tired exhausted. think cost, know, think
little bit about. know, not exposed continuous white noise naturally.
value really salient, structured sounds part natural
environment actually brain develop normally. whether not
impact, know, sleeping, not clear. don't think studies
done. really clear raise baby rats
continuous white noise, not super loud, just enough mask environmental
sounds enough keep, know, auditory cortex, part brain
hears, really delayed state essentially slow
development maturation brain. - one probably assume slowing
maturation areas brain responsible hearing might, want
underscore, might impact one's ability speak, right? isn't case
people can't hear, actually harder time enunciating particular way,
right? not able hear voice, speech patterns
change? - Well, think part that, time, develop sensitivity
specific speech sounds given language, sensitivity improves hear
it. hand, lose sensitivity
speech sounds time. part process, also selectivity,
gain, specialization even sounds, even relative noise, noisy backgrounds
things like that. tend think like signal-to-noise ratio?
brain ways trying increase signal-to-noise ratio order make
clear. Part hear lays foundation
signal-to-noise ratio, can imagine child raised continuously white
noise really deprived kind sounds really necessary


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press

experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago

severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good

ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years

trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


speech language probably one profound examples that. - get
lot questions use white noise sleep. particular, people want
know whether not using white noise machine machine program makes
sound waves, instance, assists infant sleeping, going bad
flooding auditory system bunch essentially white noise
disorganized noise? answer question? - Not yet. think
asking really important question parents using white noise
generators almost universally now, good reasons. know, hard
kids night. got three kids tempted think
use tools just soothe get bed, especially
was, like, tired exhausted. think cost, know, think
little bit about. know, not exposed continuous white noise naturally.
value really salient, structured sounds part natural
environment actually brain develop normally. whether not
impact, know, sleeping, not clear. don't think studies
done. really clear raise baby rats
continuous white noise, not super loud, just enough mask environmental
sounds enough keep, know, auditory cortex, part brain
hears, really delayed state essentially slow
development maturation brain. - one probably assume slowing
maturation areas brain responsible hearing might, want
underscore, might impact one's ability speak, right? isn't case
people can't hear, actually harder time enunciating particular way,
right? not able hear voice, speech patterns
change? - Well, think part that, time, develop sensitivity
specific speech sounds given language, sensitivity improves hear
it. hand, lose sensitivity
speech sounds time. part process, also selectivity,
gain, specialization even sounds, even relative noise, noisy backgrounds
things like that. tend think like signal-to-noise ratio?
brain ways trying increase signal-to-noise ratio order make
clear. Part hear lays foundation
signal-to-noise ratio, can imagine child raised continuously white
noise really deprived kind sounds really necessary


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


develop properly. think regard tools babies, think study
it, try understand definitively. think saw rodents tell
us potential, know, things concerned about. But,
again, not really clear, just using night, whether effects. -
guess critical question number people going asking
decide use white noise machine not help keep three children
asleep? - Well, think short answer no. mean, obviously lot work
thinking work thought carefully, kinds
noise, or, wouldn't even call noise, sounds can use can equally
soothing baby. just white noise no structure,
essentially masking natural sounds. think goal really
replace

00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language Brain

natural sounds structure brain way want
healthy. - Well, know finished medical training, went to,
course, specialize neurosurgery. last checked, spend days
either running laboratory clinic running department, clinical
work laboratory work involves often removing pieces skull humans
going either removing things stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
different kinds, main focus days, course, neurobiology
speech language. aren't familiar, please distinguish
us speech versus language terms whether not different brain areas control
them? know lot interest speech language hearing
relate one another. talk bit about, instance, emotions
facial expressions play this, hand gestures, et cetera.
uninformed person, me, quite direct, brain areas control
speech language? really, especially humans,
different? mean, sophisticated language compared number
species. landscape look like there? - Yeah, well, fascinating
question, going just try connect couple dots here,
earlier work medical school, lot call
neurophysiology, putting electrodes auditory cortex understanding


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


brain responds sounds, actually mapped things
sensitivity sensitive periods. experience Mike Merzenich thinking
plasticity regulated brain particular sound represented
brain activity something that, know, really formative me.
medical student going back medical studies,
combination seeing awake brain surgeries department really well
known for. One mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered methods taking
care patients brain tumor able surgeries safely keeping
patients awake mapping language. - talking listening,
essentially conversation patients portion skull
removed, stimulating or, cases, removing areas brain,
right? - exactly right, thing off not essentially, just
that. difference conversation might patient
undergoing awake brain surgery can't see face can't see
face. actually sterile drape actually separates operating field,
looking interacting neuropsychologist, can talk
can hear voice vice versa. really, really important way
can protect areas really critical language, time,
accomplish mission getting seizures control getting brain tumor
removed. - occasionally encounter brain area, maybe
stimulating considering removing brain area, suddenly patient will start
stuttering will hard time formulating sentence? essentially
looking for? looking regions okay not okay probe? - Exactly,
first thing use small electrical stimulator probe different
parts areas think might related important language talking
even movements arm leg. call brain mapping. use
small electrical current delivered probe can just put spot.
areas really interested are, course, areas right
around part pathological, part injured, part brain
tumor want remove, can apply probe transiently, meaning
temporarily, activate it. stimulating part brain controls
hand, hand will move, will jerk. Sometimes fist will made, something like that.
times, someone counting just saying days week, can
stimulate different area stops speech altogether. call


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never

supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


speech arrest. someone looking pictures describing pictures
stimulate particular area, stop speaking words start coming
slurred can't remember name object seeing picture.
things listening really carefully apply focal
stimulation. call brain mapping. - surprising,
maybe even want offer one outrageous examples things
people suddenly done failed able consequence brain
mapping? - Well, think thing striking that, know,
areas stimulate, altogether, can shut someone's
talking. person says, "I wanted say it, couldn't get words out." even
though seen thousands times now, still exciting every time see
because, exciting seeing brain, physical organ, part
body, outside veins top it, doesn't look like machine.
something like focally change way works, see
person can't talk anymore say, "I know want say, couldn't get
words out," confronted idea organ basis speech
language way beyond that, obviously, know, functions
thinking feeling emotions, everything. that, me, constant
reminder of, know, really special thing brain compute
many things do, particular area around speech language,
generating words, something really unique species, just extraordinary
see. Again, even though seen thousands times, just connection
doesn't look like machine,

00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy

something quite complicated, precise, remarkable. -
ever see emotional responses stimulation particular areas? ever
hear see emotional responses associated particular types speech?
Because, instance, curse words known to, people Tourette's often will curse,
not always, sometimes tics things. learned
colleague curse words certain structure them. usually
heavy kind sharp consonant front, right, allows people, least
described me, sort emotional release. not word like murmur,


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel

car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer

digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


kind soft entry here, not using technical language, pick
favorite curse word there, folks. not going shout now say
now, certain words structure that, motor patterns
involved saying word, imagine emotional response
unto itself. stimulating blocking different brain areas, ever
see people get angry sad happy relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely seen
cases can invoke anxiety, stress, think also areas
can stimulate can also evoke opposite that, sort like calm state. -
think brain area slightly hyperactive you, least me.
years known you, always been, least externally, calm person.
mean, always find amusing work speech language
calming voice. really serious. think huge variation
that, right, terms people speak accent words. - Absolutely, yeah.
areas, example, orbitofrontal cortex showed
stimulate there... orbitofrontal cortex part brain eyes.
call orbitofrontal, meaning eye orbit
frontal lobe, area right here. really complex functions. really
important learning memory. one things observed
stimulate there, people tended reduction stress,
much related state being, meaning someone already kind feeling
normal stimulate there, didn't much. someone anxious
state, actually relieved that. seen corollary true, too,
areas like amygdala parts insula
stimulate, can cause acute temporary anxiety, nervous feeling,
stimulate insula, people can acute feeling disgust. So, know,
brain different functions different nodes help process way feel.
Certainly, think that, degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect imbalance
electrical activities areas. One things something will
never forget taking care young woman uncontrolled seizures. call
epilepsy. medical condition someone uncontrolled electrical activity
brain. Sometimes can see convulsions people shaking
lose consciousness. kind seizures people can
don't lose consciousness, can experiences just come nowhere
just result electrical activity coming brain. six years ago,


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


took care young woman diagnosed psychiatrically anxiety disorder
several years. turns wasn't really anxiety disorder. actually
underlying seizures, epilepsy activating part brain evokes,
know, anxious feelings. - discovered? know lot people
anxiety. mean, absence brain scan, one
suspect maybe tumor condition causing
neurons become hyperactive? - Yeah, really important many people
anxiety, vast, vast majority not
seizures brain. think one ways diagnosed nature
panic attacks not triggered anything.
just happen spontaneously. can happen seizures sometimes.
just come nowhere. don't fully understand can trigger them,
weren't things typically anxiety-provoking. something just
happened sudden. brought up, not something
can see MRI. not see look structure brain, MRI,
seizures. way actually prove
actually putting electrodes brain proving attacks
localized part called amygdala, medial part temporal
lobe, here, associating electrical activity seeing
electrodes symptoms had,

00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery

ultimately needed kind surgery awake order remove
safely. - Speaking epilepsy, number people epilepsy know
people do. drugs epilepsy satisfactory? know, think things
like Depakote, know, adjusting excitation inhibition brain. mean,
good drugs epilepsy? know not great drugs lot
conditions. often one need neurosurgery order treat epilepsy?
can treated often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, lot
people seizures can completely controlled medications, lot.
one-third people epilepsy, define anyone
three seizures that, know, third actually don't
control modern medications nowadays. data


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


suggests two three medications, actually doesn't matter necessarily
anti-seizure medications is, data suggests just tried
two three, fourth, fifth, sixth, beyond not likely help control it.
situation, unfortunately, lot medications great people,
another subset, can't control it, comes particular part brain.
Now, fortunately, subset, another part group can benefit
surgery actually either removes part brain, nowadays, use
stimulators now sometimes put electrical stimulation part brain help
reduce seizures. - said third people epilepsy might need
neurosurgery? - Well, mean is, like, continue seizures
not controlled medications, going another subset
may benefit surgery. probably not whole third, subset that.
just say epilepsy can really hard get fixed. people
seizures come one spot or, know, area, surgery can great.
comes multiple areas comes whole brain, think
methods control it. Fortunately, nowadays, actually ways.
Surgery now, us, doesn't just mean removing part brain. Half now
use stimulators

00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy

modulate state brain can help reduce seizures. - heard
ketogenic diet originally formulated order treat epilepsy and,
particular, kids. true, ketogenic state low blood
glucose reduce seizures? - great question. honest, don't know
actually originally designed treat seizures, can tell sure
people, just like medications, can life-changing thing. can
completely change way brain works. not something
everybody, people, no question, beneficial
effects. think determined still, like works. - heard similar
things ketogenic diet people Alzheimer's dementia, nothing
particularly relevant ketosis Alzheimer's per se, Alzheimer's
changes way neurons metabolize energy shifting alternate fuel source
can sometimes make people feel better, number people now trying it.


not blood glucose carbohydrates causing Alzheimer's.
people get confused often just something can help doesn't mean
opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

lot adults, know, will try well. - Interesting. like take quick break
acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called
AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason
still take Athletic Greens usually twice day, gets probiotics
need gut health. gut important. populated gut microbiota
communicate brain, immune system, basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health, probiotics
Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health. addition, Athletic Greens
contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met, tastes great. like try Athletic
Greens, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman, give five free travel
packs make really easy mix Athletic Greens road,
car, plane, et cetera. give year's supply Vitamin D3+K2.
Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

opposite harming somebody. find really interesting. Sometime check back
happening terms ketogenic diets epilepsy. said
cases, can help. observation made children
adults? thought that, originally, ketogenic diet epilepsy really
pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, right. lot focus really kids
epilepsy, certainly safe thing try,

00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Seizure Types

get five free travel packs year's supply Vitamin D3+K2. curious
epilepsy another reason. taught epilepsy imbalance
excitation inhibition brain. think electrical storms give
people either grand mal, know, shaking kind convulsions. years ago,


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


reading book, wonderful book actually, called "Einstein Love" Dennis
Overbye. Einstein guess personal life. People knew
claimed sometimes walk along, every just
stop kind stare off space anywhere minute three five minutes,
speculated absence seizures. absence seizure?
reason ask occasionally will walking along thinking
something stop. mind, thinking time, realize
see outside, might appear just kind absent.
absence seizure? strikingly different description from, say,
grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like mentioned before, depending
seizure activity spreads brain actually propagates, stays one
particular spot doesn't spread entire brain, can really different
manifestation. can represent really differently. absence seizure just one category
different kind seizures can lose consciousness basically,
mean not fully aware going environment, okay?
sort taken offline temporarily consciousness, still be,
example, standing, people not paying attention, may not even
aware happening. - types seizures? - Well, know,
think kinds, classic ones temporal lobe seizures.
ones come medial structures like amygdala hippocampus.
Oftentimes people, seizures coming that, may taste
something unusual like metallic taste smell something like smell burning
toast, something like that. people, temporal lobe seizures, will
deja vu. will experience somewhere before,
just precursor seizure. just highlights people seizures
coming areas, sometimes hijack part brain really for.
amygdala hippocampus, example, really important learning
memory. not surprising people seizures can evoke
feeling deja vu can evoke feeling anxiety. areas right
next it, example, areas really important processing smell.
areas right next can kind complex set
symptoms, weird taste, smell toast, feeling deja vu, classic
temporal lobe seizure, parts brain process
functions right next other. - told nocturnal seizures,


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.

severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years

improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


woken sometimes sleep felt convulsion, sort
sense buzzing back head. happened two three times
college. Well, woke girlfriend distraught, like, "You
seizure." full convulsion sleep. correct? thing
nocturnal seizures? reflect? eventually stopped happening,
couldn't tether kind life event. wasn't kind combat sport
anything time, wasn't drinking alcohol much, never really thing.
nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - need brain surgery? [Andrew
laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures just another form. Like, again, epilepsy
seizures can many different forms not just, like, brain,
also happen. people who, whatever reason,
timed circadian rhythm. actually not just happening night, certain
period night people certain stage sleep brain state
vulnerable seizure, basically just one form that. Again,
not just coming from, also happening timed
things happening body. - Interesting. Well, eventually
stopped happening

00:41:08 Brain Areas Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New
Findings

stopped worrying it. haven't seizures since. Returning speech
language, getting weaned neuroscience, learned area
brain producing speech area brain comprehending
speech. story there? still true Broca's Wernicke's
area? names neurologists, presumably, neurosurgeons discovered
different brain areas. Maybe familiarize us sort
textbook version speech language organized brain, maybe share
us little bit lesion studies led understanding,
love hear bit laboratory discovering things actually
organized, discussions last year so,
seems like, well, just blunt, seems much know
textbooks wrong. - Well, love question because, me, central
research do, intersection laboratory


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-

tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news

interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


research interfaces see patients. one things
fascinated early medical training brain mapping
watching mentor taking care patients had, know, brain
tumors certain part brain that, lot times, seeing
patient not correlate taught medical school. And, know,
people will think, well, might exception, see couple times
kind interested problem, know, poses serious challenge
learned think things operate.
actually got really interested trying figure because, earlier, talked
just extraordinary thing brain create words sentences,
process getting ideas mind yours.
incredible thing, right? basis communication, high information communication
two individuals really unique humans. historical times,
works controversial day one neuroscience. long time ago,
people thought bumps head corresponded different faculties
mind. example, bump here, might corresponding intelligence
another one here, know, vision kind things.
nowadays call phrenology, kind starting point. lot been,
course, debunked, see little statues different brain partitions
someone's head, essentially people thinking brain
worked back then, couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when,
actually, much related discovery language. modern
neuroscience, meaning moving beyond idea bumps scalp
corresponded faculties mind, things actually
brain themselves, weren't corresponding things see
superficially, like scalp externally, something brain itself.
mean, seems obvious now, back then, big academic, know,
debate. first observation think really impactful area language
observation French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
observed patient, not surgery in, seen taken
care of, person couldn't talk. And, particular, called individual Tan
words produce tan, tan. part,
generally understand kind things people asking about,
thing utter mouth words, tan, tan. eventually


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train

example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


happened individual passed away, way neuroscience
done back basically wait happened remove brain
see part brain affected patient called Tan.
Broca found part left frontal lobe, frontal lobe
area like described earlier, is, know, behind forehead, here,
back frontal lobe, claimed seat articulation
brain. literally used something like French, seat articulation, meaning
part brain responsible us generate words. 50
years later, story becomes complicated German neurologist named Carl
Wernicke. Wernicke described different set symptoms patients
observed different phenomenon people produce words, lot
words, fluent sense that, like, sound like real
words different language, example. us call that, like, word
salad jargon. essentially making words, not intentional.
just way words came out. addition that, observed
people also not understand said them.
conversation, asking you, "Am woman?" might nod head,
know, just not processing question. two
observations. One frontal lobe important articulating speech, creating
words expressing fluently. different part brain called left
temporal lobe, area right ear, area think
claimed really important understanding. two major functions language,
speak understand, kind pinned that, basic
idea textbooks for, know, 200 years. - certainly taught. -
[Eddie] right? - Oh, yeah, certainly still, still teach
undergraduates, graduate students, medical students that. - Well,
learned, too, medical school. saw reality started taking care
patients not simple. fact, part fundamentally wrong. just
nutshell, nowadays, after, know, looking carefully hundreds
patients, shown surgeries, example, posterior part frontal
lobe, lot times, people no problem talking whatsoever kind
surgeries, different part brain call precentral gyrus.
precentral gyrus part brain intimately associated motor cortex.
motor cortex part brain map entire body


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.

occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,

Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical

essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press

actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.

example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals

severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good

trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer

first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?

was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


part corresponds feet, part corresponds hands.
another part comes laterally side brain
corresponds lips, jaw, larynx, seen patients
surgeries injuries part brain, actually can really interrupt
language, not simple just moving muscles vocal tract, also
important formulating expressing words. Broca's area think
field now recognizes not just work, many people
studied stroke beyond, idea basis speaking
Broca's area fundamentally wrong right now, figure correct
textbooks kind understand can continue make progress.
Now, terms major area call Wernicke's area posterior
temporal lobe, held, think, quite legitimately time. area
super careful surgery there. area where,
mistake cause stroke remove much tumor
there, go far beyond it, person can really, really hurt. Like,
condition call aphasia may not able understand words,
may not able remember word trying say. know
trying say, can't remember precise word goes object
trying think of. may even produce words described
like word salad jargony. So, know, might say something like tamiranai.
not real word, sounds like be, know? just
part brain role not just understanding hear, also
actually really important role sending commands different parts
brain control say. - Not long ago, good friend Rick Rubin
conversation medicine science, Rick asked question,
"What percentage learned graduate and/or medical school think
correct?" interesting answer. share us? - don't
know. don't remember exact. say regard brain
particular, say 50% gets right accurate helpful, another
50% just approximation oversimplification going on. example
talked about, language just example that. just things
make easier learn easier teach easier even think about,
probably continue teaching way do. think time goes on,
complexity reality brain works is, well, first all, still trying


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


figure out, second all, complex still incomplete story. - early
days. get technical advances allowing
correction errors field made. And, look, no disrespect brain
explorers came us, ones come us will correct us, right?
way game played. hearing certain truths
people accept, half information

00:53:23 Lateralization Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes

still open debate maybe even complete revision. One thing
learned language neural circuits underlying language heavily
lateralized, structures, Broca's Wernicke's structures
brain responsible speech comprehension speech sit mainly one side
brain, not mirror representation another equivalent area
opposite side brain. haven't poked around lot brains,
certainly you, Eddie, done far have, done fair share
nonhuman species little bit humans, almost every structure, almost every
structure matching structure side brain, say
hippocampus, really mean two hippocampi, one side brain.
language, taught, heavily lateralized, is, one. raises
two questions. One, true? true, equivalent real estate
opposite side brain not function one on,
say, left side performing? - Well, one things is, again, like
mostly true, not 100%. mean complicated. people
right-handed, 99% time, language part brain left side. -
equivalent brain area right side not language? -
Well, know, thing incredible look right side look
carefully, either MRI actually look brain slides
microscope, looks very, similar. not identical, looks very, similar.
gyri, bumps brain that, know, different contours
valleys call sulci, look basically same. Like, mirror
anatomy left right side, not clear special actually
left side house language. know, use
time assessing figuring out, know, surgery, right-


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-

tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train

example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


handed, 99% time, language going left side brain. -
handedness genetic way? mean, grew up, - Yes. - pen pencil
crayon placed hand presumably, started using... father left-
handed, grew South America, forced force
become right-handed. actually used restrict movement left hand
forced write... hook lefties hook righties. know
deep dive probably don't want go every derivation this,
somebody left-handed, naturally just starts writing left hand,
genetic predisposition left-handed? - Absolutely. No question it.
Handedness not entirely strongly genetic. something ties this,
handedness, example, part brain
controls language? Well, turns parts control hand close
areas really responsible vocal tract. Again, part motor cortex
part brain area called precentral gyrus. theories that,
proximity, parts brain might develop together early
utero might head start compared right side,
head start things solidify there. one theory happens.
people left-handed, still turns vast majority people
language left side, not 99%, like 70%. left-handed,
still likely language part brain going left side,
going greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, either
hemispheres right side. just make little bit interesting
people strokes left side, lucky enough recover
strokes, sometimes involves reorganization, term call plasticity
earlier, areas around stroke take new function way
didn't before. can certainly happen left hemisphere,
also instances right hemisphere can also start take function
language left transfers right. thing
think lot machinery probably exists sides, don't use
together time. fact, may strongly bias one side other. Just like
use two hands very, different ways, little bit brain.
Well, brain actually use hands
different ways. thing goes language, that, again,
substrates, organ, language organ, part brain process probably


similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.

part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years

tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really

started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret

trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity

cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news

interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside

everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

similar machinery left side right, right may
capability it, real, everyday use, brain specializes one sides

00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits

order us use functionally. theory. - bilingual, correct? - Yeah. -
[Andrew] speak English Chinese? - Yeah. - people bilingual
learn two more, well, bilingual two, obviously, learn languages
say languages early time life, use brain area
generate language? perhaps use left side speak English right
side speak Chinese? know anything bilingualism brain? - Well,
think know lot bilingualism brain. answers still there,
final answers it, part answer yes, absolutely, use parts
brain similarly. actually study lab right now looking
people speak one language another bilingual, looking
brain activity patterns occur hearing one language versus
other. striking see, actually, overlapping really can be. Even
though person may no idea language hearing, English
part brain still processing maybe trying interpret English
lens, example. short answer bilingualism, shared
circuitry, shared machinery brain allows us process both,
not identical. part brain, signals can
very, different. mean precisely not instantaneous detecting
one sound next, memory sequences particular sounds
give rise things like words meaning, can highly variable one
individual next, neurons very, sensitive sequences
sounds, even though sounds might overlap
languages. - Fascinating. Okay, talked brain areas little bit
lateralization.

01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction Ear Brain

want get back hands things related emotion little bit.
maybe now go brain areas start ask question,


exactly represented mapped there? people perhaps aren't familiar
brain mapping representation receptive fields, perhaps simplest analogy
might visual system look face, know you, recognize you,
certainly brain areas responsible face recognition. fact
know face, listening, looking Eddie's face, fact
know face well aware cells
represent edges represent dark light, combine
call hierarchical structure. sort build basic elements simple little
dots, lines things move, et cetera, give coherent representation
face. think language, think words just talking. sit
long podcast think asking question, don't even think
words want say much. mean, think little bit, one
hope, don't think individual syllables unless trying to, know, accent
something word particular difficulty saying want change
cadence, et cetera. represented neurons, nerve cells
areas? representing vowels, consonants? things like inflection...
Like occasionally will poke fun upspeak, there's, think, healthy, normal
version upspeak somebody's asking question, like, instance, that?
appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

appropriate use upspeak opposed saying something not
question putting lilt end sentence, call upspeak,
doesn't fit person saying. world contained
brain areas, represented, me, perhaps one interesting
questions, know lands square wheelhouse. - Sure, get this,
Andrew, one exciting stuff happening right now
understanding brain processes exact questions. asked
earlier, know, difference speech language? Speech
corresponds communication signal. corresponds moving mouth
vocal tract generate words, hearing auditory signal.
Language something much broader. refers extracting
words saying, call pragmatics sort getting gist
saying? another aspect call semantics. understand
meaning words sentences? another part call syntax,
refers words assembled grammatical form.
really critical parts language, speech just one form language. many


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,

individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


forms like sign language, reading. important modalities reading.
research really focuses area calling speech, again, production
audio signal can't see microphones picking up.
vibrations air created vocal tract picked
microphone case recording, also picked sensors ear.
tiny vibrations ear picking translating electrical
activity. ear periphery translates sounds different
frequencies. main thing take speech signal kind sound
decompose it, meaning separate sound different kind signals.
case hearing, separating low, middle, high frequencies
very, high resolution. quickly, really fine way
separate different sounds. look periphery near nerve
goes ear, nerve fibers, tuned low frequencies,
tuned high frequencies, tuned middle
frequencies, ear doing. taking words splitting
different frequencies. - aren't familiar
thinking things so-called frequency space, bass tones lower
frequencies high-pitched tones higher frequencies, just make sure
everyone's page. sound voice, sound voice,
sound environment broken frequencies.
broken narrow channels frequency, they, want avoid
nomenclature here, binned fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause
know low, medium, high, but, instance, can detect whether not something's
approaching moving away depending whether not sweeps louder
[imitates sound approaching] [imitates sound receding], right, towards away.
subtle, course combined see movement,
finely sliced perception auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. mean,
take millisecond cues, millisecond differences sound coming
one ear, say right ear versus left, understand direction
sound came from. millisecond differences, precise
works. hand, lot computation lot analysis
go up, lot work focused part brain call
cortex. cortex outermost part brain believe sounds
actually converted words language. transformation where,


ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

ear, words decomposed turned elemental frequency channels,
goes auditory system, hits cortex. things
happen obviously gets cortex, gets cortex,
something special going on, part brain looking specific
sounds. specifically mean sounds human language,
ones different consonants vowels different language. One
ways studied looking patients epilepsy. lot
cases MRI looks completely normal, put electrodes
surgically part brain. temporal lobe very, common place,
done lot work looking temporal lobe processes speech sounds
looking seizures start, also brain
mapping language speech can protect areas. want identify
areas want remove cure someone's seizures, also want figure
areas important speech language protect can
surgery effective safe. research, become
really important addition knowledge electrodes directly recording
human brain surface. lot technology work right now
recording order millimeters, can record millisecond time resolution
neural activity, see extraordinary patterns activity people hear
words sentences. look part brain call Wernicke's area
part temporal lobe, whole area lights hear words speech.
not way like general light bulb warming generally lit up,
actually see something much, much complicated,
pattern activity, done last 10 years try understand
pattern come from? look individual site part
brain, see? parts words coded electrical
activity parts brain? Remember, cortex using electrical activity
transmit information analysis, eavesdropping
part brain processing speech try understand individual
site doing. - sites doing, give us examples
sites doing? So, instance, sites specific for,
say even listening consonants vowels inflection emotionality?
there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - makes these, makes cells fire?
- Yeah, gets excited? - Yeah. - gets going hearing speech.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


particular, really focal sites, again, just order millimeter
or, level, single neurons tuned consonants, tuned
vowels, tuned particular features consonants. mean
different categories consonants. class consonants call plosive
consonants. little bit linguistic jargon, going make point
certain classes sounds, make them, requires actually
close mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now going thinking this.
plosive, like plosive, like saying word plosive requires that. - Exactly, cool
actually no idea going mouth speak.
really no idea. - people definitely no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie
laughs] - Well, not just like terms saying sometimes, actually like
actually moving, know, different parts vocal tract.
feeling actually required understanding, never able speak 'cause
complex. complex feat. people say complex
motor thing species just speaking. Not, know, extreme feats
acrobatics athleticism speaking. - especially one observes, know,
opera people who, know, freestyle rappers. course not just lips.
tongue.

01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations

mentioned two structures Pharynx larynx main ones. Can
tell us, just educate us superficial level pharynx larynx
differentially? 'Cause think people aren't going familiar that. - Okay,
sure. talk primarily larynx second, think
speaking, really, shaping breath.
even get larynx, got start expiration. fill
lungs push air out. normal part breathing. really
amazing speech language evolved take advantage normal
physiologic thing, add larynx, larynx exhaling,
brings vocal folds together. people call vocal cords. not really
cords. really vocal folds. two pieces tissue come together,
muscle brings together. happens air comes
vocal folds together, vibrate really high frequencies, like 100 200


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


hertz. probably 100 hertz. average- - Whereas 200. [Andrew
laughs] - No, no. male voices around 100, okay? average female
voice around 200 hertz. - Well, know, always voice. - Yes,
yes, same- - point shame kid. Folks, voice never
changed. always voice. discussion another time. - Yeah,
well, great voice, know, great baritone voice, know voice,
low-frequency voice. reason men women generally different voice
qualities size larynx shape it, okay?
general, men larger voice box larynx, vibrating frequency,
resonance frequency vocal folds air comes 100
hertz men 200 women. happens is, okay, take breath
in, air coming out, vocal folds come together air goes
through. creates sound voice call voicing, energy
voice. not just voice characteristic, energy voice. coming
larynx there, noise. source voice.
happens energy, sound goes parts vocal tract, like
pharynx oral cavity, mouth tongue lips.
things shaping air particular ways create
consonants vowels. mean shaping breath. just starts
exhalation. generate voice larynx, everything
larynx moving around, just like way mouth right now, shape air
particular patterns can hear words. - Fascinating, immediately
makes wonder primitive non-learned vocalizations like crying
laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. sorts vocalizations
produced language areas like Wernicke's, unique
neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. call vocalizations.
vocalization basically someone can create sound, like cry moan,
kind sound, also involves exhalation air. also involves phonation
level larynx vocal folds come together create audible sound.
turns actually different areas, people injuries
speech language areas oftentimes can still moan, can still vocalize,
different part brain, say area even nonhuman primates
can specialized, know, vocalization. different form communication
words, example. - intricacy circuits brain


connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

connections pharynx larynx just, almost overwhelming terms
thinking just complicated must be, yet general features
principles

01:17:37 Mapping Language Brain

starting emerge work work others. think
work think about, instance, Wernicke's area, record neurons
Wernicke's area different locations, find kind systematic
layout? instance, terms of, talked sound frequency, know low
frequencies represented one end structure high frequencies other.
true actually, least earlier training, within ear itself, within
cochlea, early work von Bekesy cadavers, right? actually figured
dead people, incredible. fascinating literature people look
up. visual system, know that, instance, know, visual position,
things mapped systematically. words, neurons sit next
brain represent portions visual space next
real world. organization language areas like Wernicke's Broca's?
instance, think vowels, A, E, I, O, U, kind coherent unit, find
neurons next E neurons next A, E, I, O, U. vowel
representation also laid order, kind salt pepper, random? -
one the, like, important questions trying answer past
decade. part brain call primary auditory cortex,
primary auditory cortex deep temporal lobe. looked part
brain, map different sound frequencies. look front
primary auditory cortex, find low-frequency sounds, march
backwards cortex, goes low medium high frequencies. organized
really nice orderly way. turns not just one. There's, like,
mirrors tone frequency map primary auditory cortex. areas
really important speech side that. now think speech can go
straight speech cortex without go primary auditory cortex,
pathway get part brain processes speech.
looked question map, short answer yes,
map, not structured universally across people way can clearly


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

always, thank interest science.


see right now.

01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages

like salt pepper map different features speech. before, talked
sounds called plosives. make plosive mouth
something oral cavity closes temporarily, opens, creates fast
plosive sound. say dad or, know, like B ball, kind thing,
will notice lips actually close, release creates
particular sounds, okay? sounds call plosive.
like ba da ga, pa ta ka, certain class consonants call plosive
sounds. another class sounds call fricatives linguistics. Fricatives
created turbulence airstream comes mouth,
way make turbulence getting mouth lips close almost
completely shut putting tongue near teeth almost get completely
shut just narrow aperture, creates turbulence airflow
perceive high-frequency sound. sounds like sha tha,
kind things. are, look frequencies, higher frequencies,
created specific movements constrict airflow create
turbulence, hear sha, sa, tha. - say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. -
opposed plosive say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - course,
emphasizing here. Well, explains something solves mystery, recently
fascinated work physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan,
done lot work things contained pesticides foods
changing hormone levels, refers phthalates, spelled...
plosive tha, combining two, one difficult words
English language pronounce, second perhaps correct pronunciation
ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] combination plosive
one tha sounds, probably difficult. - exactly right.
fact, term that. called consonant cluster. sometimes syllables
will just one consonant, start stacking certain syllables sequence,
rules actually govern consonants can particular sequence
given language, makes complicated. certain languages lot
constant clusters others. - instance- - instance, Russian,


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


example, lot consonant clusters. English lot them.
languages very, few. example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian inventory
12 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants vowels. English,
contrast, 40 different consonants vowels. languages different
inventories. can overlap sure, different languages use different sound
elements, combine recombine elements give rise different words
meanings. - Can say complicated language there, among
complicated? Russian? - definitely high there. English
there, too, actually. Yeah, German well. - terms learning multiple languages
development, understanding one wants become bilingual
trilingual, best learn languages simultaneously development, ideally
age 12, one hopes not accent speaking later. correct,
want revise that? - Well, basically, earlier, earlier better,
intense immersive is, longer, know, can
exposed really important. lot people can get exposed early
basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, sensitive period, unless
maintained, can easily lost. think another aspect
interesting social requirements too. pretty clear can
go far just listening sounds tape recording something like that.
something extra real human interactions activates brain's
sensitivity different speech sounds

01:25:07 Motor Patterns Speech & Language

allows us become specialized given language. - returning
mapped, representations brain, starting get picture
now based plosives tha sounds. find interesting
logical maps motor structures actual pronunciation
sounds, not necessarily meaning individual words. Now, course,
related meaning individual words, makes good sense
something complex language, understand generate, map
something essentially motor design because, point out,
generate sounds hear generated others. However,
reading writing, writing certainly motor, reading involves motor


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


commands eyes et cetera. reading writing come
picture? parallel with, say neuroscience,
embedded within structures? part series
computations? - Yeah, address first part got map
different parts consonants vowels, look lay
part brain call Wernicke's area, spent lot time really just
dissecting millimeter millimeter. term used apropos. salt
pepper. not random. kind selectivity individual speech
sounds. one point want make this, English, example,
40 different phonemes. Phonemes just consonants vowels
individual speech segments. articulatory features refer to,
example, characteristic sounds generated specific movements
mouth, can less reduce 12 different features. Okay,
specific movements tongue, jaw, lips, larynx. 12
movements, just like said, Andrew, themselves, no
meaning. just movements. incredible take
12 movements put combinations start putting
sequence. humans use 12 set features generate words.
can generate nearly infinite number words code just 12 features,
something generates essentially possible meaning
humans, generate meanings, trying communicate one idea another,
which, me, extraordinary. parallel be, example, DNA. four base
pairs DNA, four base pairs specific sequence can generate
entire code life. speech way. like got fundamental
elements that, themselves, no meaning,

01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments

put together give rise every possible meaning. regard
second point reading writing, fascinating question. Speech
language part humans. part evolved,
hardwired and, know, molded experience. Reading writing human
invention. something added architecture brain.
reading writing fairly recent human evolution, essentially quick


anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained

devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,

possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

anything to, like, dramatic change in, say, new brain area kind
specialization. Instead, happens whenever kind behavior becomes
ultra specialized us organism, can sort take areas
normally involved vision, example, specialize purpose reading.
us part brain back temporal lobe interfaces
occipital visual cortex call visual word form area. actually part
brain sensitive seeing words, like, either typed handwritten.
part brain also sensitive seeing things like faces. things
conditioned important, know, survive. reading writing
invention, things mapped functions brain
already has. one really important things reading writing
learn read write, especially reading part, maps part
brain talking about, part processing speech
sounds. us kind think it, two different things. One
hearing sounds ears, reading actually seeing
things eyes getting language system. Well, turns
auditory speech cortex primal primitive fundamental area really
important speech, happens reading gets
visual cortex, going try map reading signals part brain
trying make sense sounds, sounds words, call phonology. Now,
important? lot relevance learn write. kids
dyslexia... Dyslexia neurological condition child, cases, adult,
trouble reading, example. many cases, mapping
see words way brain processes sounds
something different, little bit different people can read really well.
reading, lot times, actually activating part brain
processing words hear. - current treatment dyslexia?
heard deficit motion processing systems visual system.
know, people, eyes jumping opposed linear reading across,
suppose Chinese be... know, don't want presume people
always reading English. suppose Hebrew, going opposite side
page. can done dyslexia? modern treatments
dyslexia involve changing things speech side opposed just the, quote,
unquote, reading side, given speech reading interconnected? - Yeah,


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


absolutely. So, again, think beginning, people might thought purely
visual abstraction something really just visual system,
recognition either, depending particular
instance. clear many kids dyslexia problem
problem phonological awareness. So, know, can hard detect
may understand words saying, brain
good pattern recognition, sometimes even individual speech sounds not
crystal clear, can compensate that, can individual can hear
words not able essentially hear reading
words. can happen can disconnection
seeing need order hear words
process language. skilled readers usually need route first. got
map vision sound order get sort like foundation.
time, reading direct connection language parts brain,
don't necessarily always need map sounds. know, can basically develop
parallel route, we, readers, actually use time. example,
new word never seen before, sometimes try to, like, pronounce
mind, know, try hear word is. Even though not actually
saying it, trying just generate sounds might like.
part kind relying learn read first place,
mapping word images sounds that, know, go along them.
times, really proficient reader, just seeing words

01:34:47 Evolution Language

can map directly meaning without go process. -
Yeah, big fan listening audiobooks, course also listen podcasts
quite lot, also strong believer, based research seen,
reading books, physical books, Kindle, suppose, reading physical
book useful able articulate well structure sentences build
essentially paragraphs, required solo episodes
podcast. noticed years text messaging become popular
essentially erosion punctuation need complete
sentences, now sort transferred email well. become acceptable


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


just say, know, fragmented sentences email. seems likely starting
impact way people speak well. don't think anything
intelligence education level, aware evidence read
read whether not consume information purely reading
mainly auditory sources, change way speak? Because,
all, Wernicke's Broca's area auditory speech production areas
heavily intermeshed, make perfect sense hear
patterns sound communicated us also change way
speak. - Yeah, really fascinating point. idea there's, like,
proper way speak, like right way, example,
appropriate, know... Like, example, school, oftentimes told, like, "You
say like this, not say like that," know? every language kind
that. turns really unnatural. Languages, speech particular, change
time, evolves, can happen quickly. know, things call
dialects, example, just different ways speaking, someone can just
one environment change one dialect another, people, kind
really fixed. idea that, know, like school told
right way, reality, not true. Like, language change speech
change completely normal happens time, can really dramatic.
Like, certain cultures communities, isolated, can develop whole
new language, whole new set words, example, new ways dialects
independent people point unintelligible even others.
basic idea sound change

01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome

part way works, brain sensitive kind changes. -
Speaking learning new languages, assuming possible learn new languages
throughout lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - also heard kind
fantastical stories somebody stroke suddenly, spontaneously, can
speak French fluently, whereas prior stroke, not. merit
stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] find hard believe
complete map representation language somebody's brain
completely unaware of, damage brain area, capacity


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in

parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


speak language somehow unveiled. just seems wild, don't want
say good true nobody wants stroke, just seems outrageously
implausible. - Well, aspects certainly implausible. don't
know true case ever seen experienced even read
where, example, injury brain resulted loss of, well,
essentially gain function, meaning, like, just sudden started speaking another
language. example, stroke never spoke French,
sudden speaking, that, never heard never
seen. However, condition well acknowledged seen one case
called foreign accent syndrome, peculiar people
injury part brain sounds like starting speak
language, not actually speaking language, just sounds like it.
goes back talking earlier areas really
important speech control vocal tract, area precentral gyrus. People
documented where, know, patients strokes there, that,
sounds like speaking Spanish opposed English sounds like
intonational properties French Russian compared original native
language. not learning rest it, like meaning grammar, et
cetera, adopting phonology, part just
not working way normally does. something

01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory

actually called foreign accent syndrome people can stroke. -
Interesting. curious auditory memory. kid, used get bed
night, close eyes replay conversations heard
day people's voices. actually can remember calling house
young kids, don't speak Chinese ask you, say,
think was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, whoever answered
phone go get you, say [speaking Chinese], believe means
thank you, right? total Chinese speak, way, will never
forget that. just never forget it, hope. suppose stroke something
sort, point, forget won't know forgotten it.
seriousness, remember day. couldn't spell out, wouldn't know how,


certainly not Chinese, even transliteration, couldn't using English letters.
memories sounds stored? within days across lives,
infinite number auditory experiences, just like infinite number
visual experiences. stored, structure storage?
calling upon, besides, course, motor commands required
say just said Chinese, won't repeat again, 'cause somehow managed
get right first time, least not terribly wrong, don't want botch
second time. stored, work? And, importantly,
speak native language, English, pulling memory bank?
doesn't feel like it. just telling want say. best
communicate clearly succinctly. usually not good succinct part.
bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit

here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

bank information? keyboard computer, letters,
certain elements punctuation space. pulling from?
pulling plosives? so, can quickly? Even people
speak slowly, appears less fluid. This, me, overwhelmingly impressive
brain can that. that? - Well, first all, impressed 35
years later... [laughs] - Well, get ahold you. [laughs] - Yeah,
impressed, 35 years later, can still remember that. - that. - fine,
still impressed. clearly something important you. short
answer memory distributed. almost like question asked
ill posed 'cause asked where? Well, not one specific area. actually
really distributed. not just one particular area. fact, fairly certain
injure part brain called Wernicke's area, may still even
memories that. People can injuries Broca's area certainly precentral
gyrus able sing "Happy Birthday," example, embedded melody
highly rehearsed things like counting despite not able speak,
incredible, right? like can see patient, example, can't really put together
sentence. ask them, "How feeling today?" can't even utter
word. ask count sometimes, get number
really. things really built motor memory
distributed. not one particular part brain, actually multiple areas
memory distributed. thank God way rare
kind surgeries go in, remove piece brain,
someone forgets kind long-term memories long-term motor skills


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

neuroscience speech, language, epilepsy, much Dr. Eddie Chang.
always, thank interest science.


have. very, rare. number one question patient will ask me, like,
"Am going same? going remember, know, wife?
going remember, know, thoughts birthday 10 years old?"
never really seen kind severe amnesia unless very, severe
injury involves almost entire brain, thank God.

01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

lot information really distributed across entire brain. - Speaking
storage ability speak, amazing work achieved
pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition work bringing language
paralyzed people, essentially allowing people locked paralyzed state
otherwise unable articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially
translating neural activity areas brain produce speech
hardware, wires things sort, artificial, non-biological tools order allow
paralyzed people communicate. will provide link popular press
coverage work original papers. kind tell us
experiments look like, people locked
allow communicate, especially interesting me, directions
taking now, beyond just, know, people able think
want say words coming screen microphone,
actually making interactions people real world elaborate
real. seems mysterious people, going let Eddie tell
rather put detail it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks
asking this. really exciting recent work lab.
last decade, really focusing basic science, meaning trying
understand brain extracts produces speech sounds words. done
lot work trying figure parts brain control individual
elements give rise words meanings. six years ago
realized actually pretty good idea code works.
identified different elements decode epilepsy patients,
example, electrodes brain part surgeries,
decode different consonants vowels English. six years
ago. natural question this, understand electrical code, can


use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things

use help someone paralyzed can't get signals
brain speak normally? setting people paralyzed.
series conditions, include things like brain stem stroke. brain stem
part brain connects cerebrum, top part, thinking
lot motor control, speech, language, everything, brain stem
connects spinal cord nerves go face vocal tract.
stroke there, basically, thinking wild, creative,
intelligent thoughts mind cerebrum, can't get
words can't get hand write down.
severe form paralysis called brain stem stroke. another kind conditions
call neurodegenerative nerve cells die basically, atrophy, condition
called ALS, severe form paralysis. extreme form, people
essentially lose voluntary movement. - Stephen Hawking good
example someone ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - example someone
ALS not great example typical course ALS. reasons not
clear, progression disease largely stabilized point twitch,
know, cheek muscle move eyes, say. people, rapid,
many people, die it, actually, know, within couple years
diagnosis, so- - Yeah, lived long time that- - lived long time- - slanted-
state wheelchair. - Right, exactly. wasn't breathing, know,
tube throat, example, people severe ALS, muscles
diaphragm lungs essentially give well. get weakness
can't breathe anymore. another form paralysis. field,
kind like devastating things can happen. not going really
try compare, like, worse, know, brain tumor stroke,
bad. condition call locked refers idea can
completely intact cognition awareness no way express that, no
voluntary movement, no ability speak. devastating
psychologically socially, know, completely isolated. call
locked-in syndrome, devastating. seen throughout career,
really heartbreaking know person can't see,
can't communicate. studying patterning electrical activity
consonants vowels, essentially, figured lot codes
individual phonetic elements, took little bit detour, least part lab


started focus specific question. people kind
paralysis, intercept signals brain, cerebral cortex,
someone trying say words, can intercept
taken brain wires computer going interpret
signals translate words? three years ago, started clinical
trial. called BRAVO trial. still underway. first participant BRAVO
trial man paralyzed 15 years. 20 years old,
came United States, actually working Sonoma area
car accident, actually walked hospital day car accident,
next day, complication related large stroke
brain stem, turned devastating. didn't wake stroke
week. coma week. woke
coma, realized couldn't speak move arms legs. told
communicated us, absolutely devastating. wanted really die
time. - blink eyes move mouth way? - blink eyes,
limited mouth movements couldn't produce intelligible speech.
was, like, completely slurred incomprehensible. survived injury. lot
people kind stroke just don't survive. survived. also
realized just incredible person, like force nature terms
optimism, terms ability make friends despite condition. way
actually communicates, little bit residual neck movements,
improvised friends basically put stick attached baseball cap.
move neck, essentially type letters keyboard
screen get words. fact, communicated device
essentially peck letters one one moving neck control stick
attached baseball cap. - many years use method
communication? - [Eddie] 15 years. hadn't really spoken 15
years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. devastating injury. But, know,
something said human spirit, anyone embodies it,
Pancho, nickname, first participant trial. human spirit,
persevered, and, fact, know, thrive community, basically, friends,
able communicate slow inefficient way. Maybe part spirit
volunteered first person trial. clinical trial,
experiment. study. not approved therapy means.


really something not done before, lot ideas it,
didn't know. know, proven lot true people
normally speaking, actually put someone paralyzed, number one,
don't know code same. Number two someone not
speaking 15 years, whether signals actually still not. part
clinical trial. was, know, something hospital also FDA,
know, approve looked carefully, given lot work
done, basis might work. two half
years ago, surgery implanted electrodes onto parts brain
talking about, areas control vocal tract, areas
control larynx, areas control lips tongue jaw movements
normally speak. areas presumably may active, hope,
brain, just couldn't get control mouth normal way.
underwent surgery, brain surgery put electrode array
connected port screwed skull. port actually goes
scalp, lived now last three years. risk infection.
ports eventually become wireless future. figured
way keep port can essentially connect computer
port. electrode array implanted part brain
important speech, connected port, connect wire port
translates call analog, know, brainwaves converts
digital signals. computer takes digital signals individual
sites speech cortex translates words. - Can describe us
first time Pancho spoke engineered device?
experience like you? And, least conveyed you,
experience like him? somebody essentially locked-in, except
this, know, rather crude pecking device, although thoroughly impressed
adaptive adaptable Pancho was, friends engineering device
really nothing short clever otherwise truly locked in, right?
moment like? can imagine. - moment incredible.
truly incredible able see try get word was, practical
purposes, unintelligible, able take brain activity translate
text screen. did. took brainwaves, put
machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm can pick very,


subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

subtle patterns, can't actually see eye, brain activity
translate words. remember seeing happening first time.
know, doesn't happen, like, immediately. something took weeks train
algorithm interpret correctly. incredible see
reacted. prompted say given word, like, know, outside,
example, think it, try say it, finally words
appear screen. really amazing really tell
he, like, got kick start giggle, know, body
shake way head shake way start giggle,
cool see. also realized giggling, kind
screwed next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - bug
since fixed? - No, haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - haven't fixed that,
easier just tell stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] -
first word said? - Well, think one first sentences put together
was, know, can get family outside? - Meaning get room?
[laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - years, wanted get away family? - No,
think meant was, can get them- - Bring in, yeah. - Bring in.
way worked trained computer recognize 50 words. started
small vocabulary expanding speak. think just
matter time vocabularies become much, much larger. started
50-set words. created essentially possible sentences
generate 50 words. important can use
possible sentences create computational model, computer model different
word combinations give different sentences given 50 words, can
essentially call autocorrect. kind thing
texting, example. get wrong letter there, phone actually
knows, know, context correct it. decoding's
not 100% correct time, fact, far that, really helpful
features like autocorrect, stuff use routinely now texting
makes correct updates it. combination lot things. AI
translating brain activity patterns, also things learned
speech speech technologies that, know, put together
sudden, starts work. really excited first time
someone paralyzed create words sentences just


decoded brain activity. - Incredible, know humble,
going embarrass saying always knew destined great things
since early age nine first became friends. read news
coverage work Pancho release language locked-in
patient, literally, know, brought tears eyes because, know,
interesting thing fellow neuroscientists, right, explore brain try find
mechanisms, try compare people find find truths
principles build those, pretty rarely case route
exploration leads something clinical significance within one's lifetime.
mean, reality science, oftentimes distributed process.
case, magnificent thing see move along trajectory

02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation

parsing language speech areas also clinical work
parallel. Speaking which, days, hear lot Neuralink, Elon Musk's
company. neurosurgeon came briefly lab, can't take credit
knows does, Matt MacDougall neurosurgeon Neuralink.
excellent neuroscientists engineers there. hear lot
Neuralink brain-machine interface sort
laboratories going long time, press around
Neuralink promise brain-machine interface do. instance,
early discussion, talked how, know, language constrained
sound waves, typically, people communicating one person
many people podcast, instance, speech. idea thrown
use stimulating chips brain-machine
devicing perhaps one internalize 50 conversations parallel, right? 50X
communication, memory systems augmented remember 10 times
much information even twice much information given period time.
understanding Neuralink, admittedly crude
outside, discussions people there, going pursue clinical
goals first, things like trying generate smooth movement Parkinsonian patient,
trying adjust movement patterns someone Huntington's disease, instance,
things sort embark sci-fi-like explorations 50Xing


communication doubling memory capacity kinds things. Although, don't
know, may things parallel. thoughts
super capabilities brain or, don't even know word use, know,
supercharging brain, know, giving brain functions never
observed human history, right? Einsteins Feynmans
Merzenichs and, know, unclear put along line side side,
some, Michael Jordans et cetera, never heard seen
somebody can jump 20 feet air. heard people
photographic memories, don't know aware human
history memorize entire Library Congress works within
Vatican within hour. Anyway, get idea. thoughts
manipulating neural circuitry achieve suprahuman superhuman
supraphysiological functions? there, even thinking that?
possible given neurons simply communicate electrical activity
electrical activity can engineered outside brain? think it?
here, don't even think Neuralink particular. just one
example companies people laboratories quite understandably
considering this. - Well, really interesting time right now. science
going decades. work done field call brain-machine
interface going while. lot early work just trying
restore things like arm movement people monkeys control computer
cursor, example, screen. going decades.
really new industry now involved now becoming
commercialized, starting see us now cross field no
longer just research, talking medical products designed be,
know, surgically implanted cases. know, people kind
work non-invasively well don't require surgery. specific question
asking area call augmentation. can build device
essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super
communication speeds beyond speech, example, guess superior precision athletic
abilities? think serious kind questions asking now because,
mentioned, pathway far really focus medical applications.
personally don't think thought enough actually kind
scenarios going look like, don't think thought ethical


implications means augmentation particular. part
not new all. Humans throughout history things augment
function, coffee, nicotine, kinds things, kinds medications cross
medical consumer. everywhere. pursuit augmentation
performance enhancement really not new thing. questions really,
relate neurotechnologies, example, invasive nature.
example, technologies require surgery, example, something not
medical application. Again, there, not exactly new territory either. People
routinely cosmetic kind procedures physical appearance, not necessarily
cognitive. think that, provided technology continues emerge way
does, going around corner, probably not going ways
super obvious. don't think going like, can easily memorize every
fact world, forms going much incremental maybe
subtle. many ways, already now. Like, example, don't
neural interface embedded brain get information, essentially access
information world. just have, know, iPhone. Whether
faster brain interface, definitely wouldn't rule out.
think this, systems already speak communicate
evolved over, know, thousands millions years supported
neural structures bandwidth millions neurons. no technology
exists right now people thinking commercial forms, certainly not
even research labs, come anywhere close evolved
natural purposes. essentially saying two sides this, already
getting now, not new territory, topic augmentation, physical
cognitive, already surpassed that. part humans general.
entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

entering area of, like, enhanced cognition, areas think
technology going rate-limiting step far can go, not
full conversations about, number one, actually want? going
good society? gets access technology? things

02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars

going become real-world problems. - certainly lot consider.
thinking augmentation another theme yet ask


extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

extremely curious about, facial expressions. talk
relationship musculature face language communication
emotion, love to, would, touch little bit
patients like Pancho move beyond somebody locked able type
words screen thoughts. rich array information contained
within face facial expression. somebody like Pancho going
to, know, completely locked able peck letters
keyboard able just think letters spelled out,
tremendous set leaps forward towards normalcy. still far away different
Pancho speaking mouth, think, knowing people restricted,
quadriplegic, know, lot struggle real world
actually height difference sometimes seated people
standing. don't often think this, always look communicate
people different interface world. manage quite well, course.
tell us terms merging brain-machine interface
extraction speech signals people locked-in like Pancho facial
expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like described before, progress made.
proof principle can decode speech. will continue optimize,
confident going improve very, quickly coming years
point like, know, not just small vocabulary, large vocabulary
reasonable rates, level going really helpful. optimistic
that. think right time start really thinking broader vision
communication really is. example, person.
done virtually, probably, pretty easy that. could've recorded really
separate, something able actually see expressions
understand forms communication. another really important one
nonverbal, expressions making. know, example,
quizzical look face saying something not clear, sign
need rephrase say different way slow down, example.
something really excites you, want continue say talk
detail, know, essentially given thing. facial expressions actually
really important part way speak, two things. not just
expressions of, like, feeling perceiving saying, also
seeing mouth move eyes actually seeing mouth move jaw move


particular way actually allows hear sounds better.
visual information also sounds go brain going improve
intelligibility, also make natural. - memory spoken? - Perhaps. -
call people not just listening podcasts watching listening
YouTube, suppose, sort translate real world. -
Exactly, exactly. reason also interested idea not just
text screen, essentially fully computer-animated face like avatar
person's speech movements facial expressions going
complete form expression. Now, can imagine right now, might just
someone looking computer screen interpreting signals, think way
things going, next couple years, lot social interactions,
even now, going move digital virtual space. And, course,
people thinking means consumers, also really
important implications people disabled, right, going
participate that. thinking really about, people like Pancho
people paralyzed, forms BCI can order help improve
ability communicate? one essentially building holistic avatars,
know, things can essentially decode, know, essentially expressions
movements associated mouth jaw actually speak improve
communication. - envision time not long now instead
tweeting something text, avatar will, type out, avatar will just say it,
it'll image avatar saying whatever happen tweeting
moment. - working on, yeah. don't think that... going
happen going happen soon, lot progress that. And, again,
just trying enrich field, know, communication expression make
normal. actually think kind avatar way getting
feedback people learning speak speech neuroprosthetic,
device call, speech neuroprosthetic, going way
can help people learn quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying say words
come screen, actually people embody, feel like part
directly controlling illustration animation. - idea
avatar speaking otherwise write fascinating me.
Instagram, post videos, don't filter them, know lot discussion
nowadays people using filters make skin look different lighting look


different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands



needs happen brain order get words fluently. - talked little
bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun
intended, parallel surgery, not just thinking direct
instruments, also thinking like chess player several steps line
happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running
together, know run, correct? - Yeah. - find running essential
part state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. me, exercise do,
really don't physical reasons. mental reasons. can tell, example,
don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact
people. no question that, know, mind body deeply connected,
personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
really, really important. Now, operating room, me, another space, kind
like running swimming, disconnected rest world. don't
bring cell phone operating room. disconnected external world
time surgery, just focusing. Now, doesn't
mean complex thoughts something complicated.
Sometimes like that, not always like that. things
surgery are, like, routine rote muscle memory. So, example,
suturing skin certain kinds dissection drilling part bone, example,
things become rote time. So, me, even
operating room actually can sometimes fulfill purpose. really look forward
operating room intense focus allows sort disconnect
things worrying about, know, happening
outside world. know, kind things happen, certainly
no exception that. But, strangely, operating room, me, sanctuary. love
control environment. know there,
know anatomy brain, motions going routines. me,
not actually different going run letting my, know, legs move
specific ways. just thing hands. - listen music
audiobooks run, divorced technology run? - Well,


music helps me, like, just stay motivated distracted breath
things. me, way just catch with, like, world. sometimes
do, notice that, like, don't run well, example. operating room,
little different. know, different surgeons preferences. camp
don't like distraction whatsoever. like people able hear words
saying without background noise. don't really think relying
music things try put state mind. know, think just
alone just, know, trying treat way is, sacred moment
someone's life really directly hands, enough kind focuses
quickly, like that. really detaches lot things
preoccupying me, couple hours surgery, just
focused one thing only. - fantastic. Again, think of, range brain
explorers, neurosurgeons, profession, are, me, like astronauts
neuroscience really going farthest reaches possible,
testing probing really front edge discovering species
arguably care most, humans. Eddie, say, first time
became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that.
almost reluctant say, reveal part Eddie became friends
shared love birds, club school
two members, Eddie I. - Small club. - Small club. one
honorary member, certain requirements club
won't reveal. took pact secrecy, going obey pact secrecy.
sitting today, me, absolute thrill, not just
friends long got reacquainted literally halls
medicine science, really see really
representing front, absolute cutting edge exploration application. mean,
story Pancho one many patients derived tremendous benefit
work. now chair department, you, course, work alongside
individuals also incredible work spinal cord, et cetera. behalf
everyone listening, just really want thank joining us today
share information. will certainly back entire list
questions didn't time get to, also just work do, truly
spectacular. - Andrew, thanks much. know, humbled basically
just said, feel really extraordinary honor actually privilege,


know, reconnect talk ideas. probably not
random, know, ended similar spots interests. think
kids, know, starts deep interests kind nerding topics,
probably not coincidence, know, deep interest work
now. just feel really lucky able do. fun every day, almost every
day, able go work take care folks learn time
just close loop, know, apply knowledge learn one day
someone comes next week? really fun. don't know everything,
not even close it, journey figure out, really extraordinary. mean,
like said, exploring new lands. Literally operating room looking
exposed cortex trying understand safe walk part cortical
landscape trail? know, one going one going
safe versus results paralysis inability talk? Well, maybe
shouldn't call fun, important, too, addition really intellectually
important understand brain works. so, yeah, feel just really
lucky opportunity. - lucky one people
it, thank ever much.

different, lot filtering also use captions, essentially end
somewhere actual raw video spoken avatar
version it. - Yeah. - mean, mismatch spoken
caption dramatic, doesn't quite work. watch carefully
people use captions, oftentimes smoothing said
captions seems much succinct accurate. Oftentimes, reverse also
true caption inaccurate creates kind jarring mismatch.
case, think aspect clinical realm using avatar allow people like
Pancho essentially face communicates spoken language
avatar looks like fascinating indeed important,

02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment

think avatars emerge social spaces going really fascinating. get
lot questions stutter. think people stutter, anxiety-
provoking. stutter related anxiety? one stutter, can do?
stutter reflect underlying neurologic phenomenon might distinguish
one kind stutter another? can people stutter like relieve
stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter condition words can't come
fluently. ideas, got language intact. know,
remember, talked distinction language speech. Stuttering
problem speech, right? ideas, meanings, grammar, there,
people stutter can't get words fluently. speech condition, and,
particular, condition affects articulation, specifically controlling
production words really coordinated kind movements happen
vocal tract produce fluent speech. stuttering condition people
predisposition it, aspect stuttering, stutterer not
stutterer, right? people stutter don't stutter time either,
stutterer stutters times not others. And, really, main link
stuttering anxiety anxiety can provoke make worse. certainly
true, not necessarily caused anxiety. can essentially trigger make
worse, not cause it, per se. cause still really not clear,
kind brain functions talking earlier,
order produce normal fluent speech, not even conscious


going mouths, larynx. not conscious, were,
not able speak complex, precise. something
really developed abilities do, naturally, right? part
programming part learn inherently, know, just exposure.
stuttering essentially breakdown certain times machinery able
work really coordinated way. can think about, know, operations
areas controlling vocal tract. say speech like symphony. order
come normally, got not just one part, larynx, lips,
jaw. can't thing. very, precisely
activated very, precisely controlled way actually create words.
stuttering, breakdown coordination. - somebody stutter,
better address early life still neuroplasticity robust?
so, typical route treatment? imagine not brain surgery
typically. guessing speech therapists people can talk to, can
help work getting stuck relationship anxiety. - Yeah,
exactly. mean, part anxiety, lot really therapy
sort like work think tricks basically sometimes create conditions
can actually get words come out. forms stuttering really
initiation problems. Just getting started hard. want start initial
vowel consonant, won't emit. lot therapy really just focusing
on, like, create conditions, know, happen?
another aspect find interesting feedback, essentially,
hear say, example, every time say word, also hearing
saying, call auditory feedback. turns important,
sometimes change that, can actually change amount someone
stutters better worse. giving us clue brain not just focused
sending commands out, also possibly interacting part
hearing sounds, something might going connection
breaks stuttering occurs. individuals stutterers
don't stutter time. instances, something happening
particular moments very, precise coordination

02:22:55 Tools: Practices Maintaining Calm Extreme Demands

bit caffeine avoid it. work requires precision
calm, and, frankly, me, seems like running lot operations, no pun

happen, if, if-then type thinking. practices
tools use put state optimal neurosurgery for, know,
thinking scientific problems matter? keep threatening go running

don't go run swim just day two, can translation,
example, way feel operating room even way interact

personally, able opportunity disconnect while, turns
