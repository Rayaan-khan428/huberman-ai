people advice without many interruptions edits that. mean, takes
incredible amount skill probably born with. developed.
mean, whole science community proud you, man. Stanford proud you.
yeah, beautiful thing. really surprising. unclear scientist
can great podcast not just shooting shit random stuff, really
giving structured, good advice boiling state art science
something actually useful people. impressive. like holy shit,
actually pulled off. every week different topic-- mean, usually

like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: feels great. feels much like horizon still
distance front me. Every episode, just try get information there.
process talked podcast. won't go collecting
information, distilling simple notes, walking around, listening music,
trying figure motifs are, then-- just like you, don't use
teleprompter anything like that. minimal notes. feels great,
love it.

00:12:11 Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics

again, just grateful inspiring it. just want keep going
it. say also relieved sitting
recently went overseas intense war zone, literally, Ukraine. entire
time there, genuinely concerned. world's unpredictable place,
general. don't always get vote happens us. first all,
welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. like? mean,
broad level, specific level, drew there? surprised you?
think changed coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: think lot
say. first, really good back. One things go difficult
part world part world going something difficult, really
appreciate great American. Everything. easy access food.
Despite people think, stable, reliable rule law. lack corruption
can trust start business take various pursuits life
not going at-scale manipulation efforts can't succeed.
kind capitalism it's-- ideal capitalism really still burning bright
country. really makes appreciate aspects. also just ability
home generations, across generations. can grandfather
live Kentucky certain city. children lived there, live there,
just continues on. kind thing can
don't war. war destroys entire communities. destroys histories,


generations, like life stories stretch across generations. So-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. didn't even think said just now.
photographs, hard drives get destroyed just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. mean, nowadays, things exist cloud
still lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods
irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even rural parts United States,
don't exist cloud, right. lot people still, well, even towns, still love
physical photo album family. lot people still store photographs
families VHS tapes kind stuff, yeah. think-- many
things learned really felt lessons. One nobody gives damn
photos gone kind stuff, house gone. thing time
time saw people lost everything happy people.
love friends, family still alive. thing talk about.
That, fact, don't mention actually much dramatic sort vigor
trauma losing home. just non-stop saying lucky person
X person Y still here. makes realize lose everything,
still-- makes realize really matters, people life. mean,
lot people kind realize later life, facing mortality,
facing death, get cancer diagnosis, kind stuff. think people
America, California, fires, can still lose home. going
realize, like, nah. doesn't really matter. pain ass matters still
family, people, on. think intense thing-- talked several hundred
people, recorded. really struggling put
edit myself. talking 30, 40 hours footage, it--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. extremely
difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN:
extremely difficult. talked lot politicians. number two country,
number three. back talk president three-hour conversation.
easy edit. really heartfelt thoughtful folks different
perspectives geopolitics war. ones really hard edit like
grandmas middle nowhere. lost everything. still hope,
still love. have-- them, many them,
unfortunately, now hate heart. February, Russia invaded
Ukraine, thing realized War. One painful one lessons


war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.
remember lot that. now, see fabric peoples torn apart completely
hate really, really difficult. me, just realize things will just never
particular cultural, historical aspect. also, many painful ways
things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic
leader captivated minds millions built military can take
whole world. makes realize still possible. still possible.
tension. see this-- media machine, propaganda machine,
gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building
building. like makes realize like might-- thing might shake


human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

00:37:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

going start telling simulation, Joe. still trying figure
actually means. like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors,
Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink
covers foundational nutritional needs. taking Athletic Greens
since 2012 delighted sponsoring podcast. reason started
taking Athletic Greens reason still take Athletic Greens, usually twice
day, gets probiotics need gut health. gut important.
populated gut microbiota communicate brain, immune system,

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3, K2. know speak
many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,

going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

advice. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, well, surprised me, surprised world,
able talk hours cite best science going able give
people advice without many interruptions edits that. mean, takes
incredible amount skill probably born with. developed.
mean, whole science community proud you, man. Stanford proud you.
yeah, beautiful thing. really surprising. unclear scientist
can great podcast not just shooting shit random stuff, really
giving structured, good advice boiling state art science
something actually useful people. impressive. like holy shit,
actually pulled off. every week different topic-- mean, usually
positive, especially people love support. damn, thought, no way
going able pull off week week. getting better
better better. whole rant recent podcast, forget who,

here? hear many episodes done much. mean, number hours
just insane. amount passion, amount work put this, feel
like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: feels great. feels much like horizon still
distance front me. Every episode, just try get information there.
process talked podcast. won't go collecting
information, distilling simple notes, walking around, listening music,
trying figure motifs are, then-- just like you, don't use
teleprompter anything like that. minimal notes. feels great,
love it.

00:12:11 Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics

again, just grateful inspiring it. just want keep going
it. say also relieved sitting
recently went overseas intense war zone, literally, Ukraine. entire
time there, genuinely concerned. world's unpredictable place,
general. don't always get vote happens us. first all,
welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. like? mean,
broad level, specific level, drew there? surprised you?
think changed coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: think lot
say. first, really good back. One things go difficult
part world part world going something difficult, really
appreciate great American. Everything. easy access food.
Despite people think, stable, reliable rule law. lack corruption
can trust start business take various pursuits life
not going at-scale manipulation efforts can't succeed.
kind capitalism it's-- ideal capitalism really still burning bright
country. really makes appreciate aspects. also just ability
home generations, across generations. can grandfather
live Kentucky certain city. children lived there, live there,
just continues on. kind thing can
don't war. war destroys entire communities. destroys histories,


generations, like life stories stretch across generations. So-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. didn't even think said just now.
photographs, hard drives get destroyed just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. mean, nowadays, things exist cloud
still lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods
irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even rural parts United States,
don't exist cloud, right. lot people still, well, even towns, still love
physical photo album family. lot people still store photographs
families VHS tapes kind stuff, yeah. think-- many
things learned really felt lessons. One nobody gives damn
photos gone kind stuff, house gone. thing time
time saw people lost everything happy people.
love friends, family still alive. thing talk about.
That, fact, don't mention actually much dramatic sort vigor
trauma losing home. just non-stop saying lucky person
X person Y still here. makes realize lose everything,
still-- makes realize really matters, people life. mean,
lot people kind realize later life, facing mortality,
facing death, get cancer diagnosis, kind stuff. think people
America, California, fires, can still lose home. going
realize, like, nah. doesn't really matter. pain ass matters still
family, people, on. think intense thing-- talked several hundred
people, recorded. really struggling put
edit myself. talking 30, 40 hours footage, it--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. extremely
difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN:
extremely difficult. talked lot politicians. number two country,
number three. back talk president three-hour conversation.
easy edit. really heartfelt thoughtful folks different
perspectives geopolitics war. ones really hard edit like
grandmas middle nowhere. lost everything. still hope,
still love. have-- them, many them,
unfortunately, now hate heart. February, Russia invaded
Ukraine, thing realized War. One painful one lessons


war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.
remember lot that. now, see fabric peoples torn apart completely
hate really, really difficult. me, just realize things will just never
particular cultural, historical aspect. also, many painful ways
things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic
leader captivated minds millions built military can take
whole world. makes realize still possible. still possible.
tension. see this-- media machine, propaganda machine,
gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building
building. like makes realize like might-- thing might shake


human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

00:37:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

going start telling simulation, Joe. still trying figure

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

friend Lex? literally said that. debate goes back forth.


nonetheless-- LEX FRIDMAN: feel? Episode 100. feel?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, think. LEX FRIDMAN: Can imagine
here? hear many episodes done much. mean, number hours
just insane. amount passion, amount work put this, feel

00:12:11 Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics

again, just grateful inspiring it. just want keep going
it. say also relieved sitting
recently went overseas intense war zone, literally, Ukraine. entire
time there, genuinely concerned. world's unpredictable place,
general. don't always get vote happens us. first all,
welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. like? mean,
broad level, specific level, drew there? surprised you?
think changed coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: think lot
say. first, really good back. One things go difficult
part world part world going something difficult, really
appreciate great American. Everything. easy access food.
Despite people think, stable, reliable rule law. lack corruption
can trust start business take various pursuits life
not going at-scale manipulation efforts can't succeed.
kind capitalism it's-- ideal capitalism really still burning bright
country. really makes appreciate aspects. also just ability
home generations, across generations. can grandfather
live Kentucky certain city. children lived there, live there,
just continues on. kind thing can
don't war. war destroys entire communities. destroys histories,


generations, like life stories stretch across generations. So-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. didn't even think said just now.
photographs, hard drives get destroyed just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. mean, nowadays, things exist cloud
still lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods
irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even rural parts United States,
don't exist cloud, right. lot people still, well, even towns, still love
physical photo album family. lot people still store photographs
families VHS tapes kind stuff, yeah. think-- many
things learned really felt lessons. One nobody gives damn
photos gone kind stuff, house gone. thing time
time saw people lost everything happy people.
love friends, family still alive. thing talk about.
That, fact, don't mention actually much dramatic sort vigor
trauma losing home. just non-stop saying lucky person
X person Y still here. makes realize lose everything,
still-- makes realize really matters, people life. mean,
lot people kind realize later life, facing mortality,
facing death, get cancer diagnosis, kind stuff. think people
America, California, fires, can still lose home. going
realize, like, nah. doesn't really matter. pain ass matters still
family, people, on. think intense thing-- talked several hundred
people, recorded. really struggling put
edit myself. talking 30, 40 hours footage, it--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. extremely
difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN:
extremely difficult. talked lot politicians. number two country,
number three. back talk president three-hour conversation.
easy edit. really heartfelt thoughtful folks different
perspectives geopolitics war. ones really hard edit like
grandmas middle nowhere. lost everything. still hope,
still love. have-- them, many them,
unfortunately, now hate heart. February, Russia invaded
Ukraine, thing realized War. One painful one lessons


war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.

things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic

gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building

human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin

conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no

smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like

point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.

autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like

requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

00:12:11 Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics

again, just grateful inspiring it. just want keep going

recently went overseas intense war zone, literally, Ukraine. entire
time there, genuinely concerned. world's unpredictable place,
general. don't always get vote happens us. first all,
welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. like? mean,
broad level, specific level, drew there? surprised you?
think changed coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: think lot
say. first, really good back. One things go difficult
part world part world going something difficult, really
appreciate great American. Everything. easy access food.
Despite people think, stable, reliable rule law. lack corruption
can trust start business take various pursuits life
not going at-scale manipulation efforts can't succeed.
kind capitalism it's-- ideal capitalism really still burning bright
country. really makes appreciate aspects. also just ability
home generations, across generations. can grandfather
live Kentucky certain city. children lived there, live there,
just continues on. kind thing can
don't war. war destroys entire communities. destroys histories,


generations, like life stories stretch across generations. So-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. didn't even think said just now.
photographs, hard drives get destroyed just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. mean, nowadays, things exist cloud
still lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods
irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even rural parts United States,
don't exist cloud, right. lot people still, well, even towns, still love
physical photo album family. lot people still store photographs
families VHS tapes kind stuff, yeah. think-- many
things learned really felt lessons. One nobody gives damn
photos gone kind stuff, house gone. thing time
time saw people lost everything happy people.
love friends, family still alive. thing talk about.
That, fact, don't mention actually much dramatic sort vigor
trauma losing home. just non-stop saying lucky person
X person Y still here. makes realize lose everything,
still-- makes realize really matters, people life. mean,
lot people kind realize later life, facing mortality,
facing death, get cancer diagnosis, kind stuff. think people
America, California, fires, can still lose home. going
realize, like, nah. doesn't really matter. pain ass matters still
family, people, on. think intense thing-- talked several hundred
people, recorded. really struggling put
edit myself. talking 30, 40 hours footage, it--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. extremely
difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN:
extremely difficult. talked lot politicians. number two country,
number three. back talk president three-hour conversation.
easy edit. really heartfelt thoughtful folks different
perspectives geopolitics war. ones really hard edit like
grandmas middle nowhere. lost everything. still hope,
still love. have-- them, many them,
unfortunately, now hate heart. February, Russia invaded
Ukraine, thing realized War. One painful one lessons


war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.
remember lot that. now, see fabric peoples torn apart completely
hate really, really difficult. me, just realize things will just never
particular cultural, historical aspect. also, many painful ways
things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic
leader captivated minds millions built military can take
whole world. makes realize still possible. still possible.
tension. see this-- media machine, propaganda machine,
gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building
building. like makes realize like might-- thing might shake


human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth

just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.

impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

time saw people lost everything happy people.
love friends, family still alive. thing talk about.
That, fact, don't mention actually much dramatic sort vigor
trauma losing home. just non-stop saying lucky person
X person Y still here. makes realize lose everything,
still-- makes realize really matters, people life. mean,
lot people kind realize later life, facing mortality,
facing death, get cancer diagnosis, kind stuff. think people
America, California, fires, can still lose home. going
realize, like, nah. doesn't really matter. pain ass matters still
family, people, on. think intense thing-- talked several hundred
people, recorded. really struggling put
edit myself. talking 30, 40 hours footage, it--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. extremely
difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN:
extremely difficult. talked lot politicians. number two country,
number three. back talk president three-hour conversation.
easy edit. really heartfelt thoughtful folks different
perspectives geopolitics war. ones really hard edit like
grandmas middle nowhere. lost everything. still hope,
still love. have-- them, many them,
unfortunately, now hate heart. February, Russia invaded
Ukraine, thing realized War. One painful one lessons


war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.
remember lot that. now, see fabric peoples torn apart completely
hate really, really difficult. me, just realize things will just never
particular cultural, historical aspect. also, many painful ways
things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic
leader captivated minds millions built military can take
whole world. makes realize still possible. still possible.
tension. see this-- media machine, propaganda machine,
gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building
building. like makes realize like might-- thing might shake


human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk

war creates generational hate. sometimes think war thing kills
people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. don't directly
think secondary tertiary effects lasts decades.
anyone lost father mother daughter son, now hate not just
individual soldiers leaders invaded country entirety
people. not hate Vladimir Putin hate Russian military. hate
Russian people. tears fabric thing that, me-- half family's
Ukraine, half family Russia. is-- remember pain triumph
World War two still resonates entire family tree. so, remember
Russians Ukrainians fought together Nazi invasion.
remember lot that. now, see fabric peoples torn apart completely
hate really, really difficult. me, just realize things will just never
particular cultural, historical aspect. also, many painful ways
things will never same. seen possible
major hot war 21st century. think lot people watching this. China
watching this. India watching this. United States watching thinking can
actually large-scale war. think lessons learned that. Might
kind lead major World War III 21st century. one things realized
watching whole scene don't know shit going happen
21st century. might-- kind intuition like surely not going
another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: back normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back normal-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whatever is. LEX FRIDMAN: remember, end
World War I, Woodrow Wilson called it, war end wars. Nobody ironically,
dark way, also roaring 20s people believed this. will never
another World War. 20 years that, rise Nazi Germany. charismatic
leader captivated minds millions built military can take
whole world. makes realize still possible. still possible.
tension. see this-- media machine, propaganda machine,
gotten see every aspect of. still fueling division America
China. Russia India. Africa complicated thing trying
figure with, against. just tension building
building. like makes realize like might-- thing might shake


human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

00:37:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

human civilization may not far off. realization get really feel.
mean, kinds lessons. one propaganda. got to--
get lot letters, emails. full really intense language, full
hate every side toward me. Or, well, hate towards representing side X.
X stands variable every side. either Zelensky show, Putin
show, NATO show, America-- America show-- American empire show.
Democrat Republican. already been, country,
politicized. think sense Ukraine place full corruption.
sending money there? think kind messaging Republican
side. Democratic side-- not even keeping track actual messaging
conspiracy theories narratives, are-- tension there. get
feel directly. get really experience large number
narratives extremely confident know truth. People
convinced, first all, not lied to. People Russia think no
propaganda. think that, yes, yes, like state-sponsored propaganda,
smart enough ignore lame propaganda everywhere. know
can think own, know truth, everybody kind speaks
way. Everybody United States says, well, yes, mainstream media,
full messaging propaganda, smart. can think own. course,
see that. Everybody says this. conclusion thought
often hatred towards group, whatever group is. lost,
intense feeling hatred. really difficult field walk

00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate

calmly open mind try understand really going on.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: super intense. words come mind
hear this. mentioned something seems hate generalizes.
entire group entire country. think hate generalizes
love may may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: had-- sort one, can
imagine, kind question asked is, love hate heart?
question asked almost everybody. dig exact question
asking. think beautiful things heard people
full hate able self-introspect it. know shouldn't feel it,


can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

can't help it. not-- know ultimately thing helps helps
everyone feel love fellow man, can't help it. know. like drug,
say like hate escalates, like vicious spiral. just can't help it.
question also asked is, think ever able forgive Russia?
much thought almost-- split, people will say no. will never able
forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization talked
earlier, even include Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: Russians. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: statements, mean Russians. LEX FRIDMAN:
nothing bad worse part army invades.
people just sitting there, good Germans, people just quietly
going lives, just bad, not worse, perspective. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Earlier, said going Ukraine now allowed realize
just many positives United States. good friend.
know him. won't name name, communicated three us
tier-one Special Operations. spent years deployments. Really amazing
individual. remember pandemic hit, said text thread know,
Americans aren't used government interfering plans. Around world,
many people familiar governments dramatically interfering plans.
Sometimes even seemingly random way. not braced that. mean,
get speeding tickets, lines vote things like that. think
pandemic one first times, least life, can remember
really seemed like government impeding people naturally wanted do.

00:26:23 Typical Day Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars

shock people here. might seem like somewhat
mundane question, something saw social media. lot people
asking ask you, curious too. typical day like
there? sleeping bed, sleeping ground? Everyone seems
want know. eating? eating day? eating
steak? you-- fairly deprived conditions there? saw
couple photos posted doors front rubble. pith helmet one
case. typical day like there? LEX FRIDMAN: two modes.
One them-- spent lot time Kyiv, much safer than-- may obvious


state people don't know, middle country, much
safer actual front. word battle happening. much, much safer
Kyiv even Lviv Western part country. times spent Kyiv
fundamentally different time spent front. went Kherson
region, lot really heated battle happening. several
areas. Kharkiv. Northeast country. Donbas
region, East country. Kherson region, which, way,
not good geography, Southeast country. where, least
there, lot really heated fighting happening.
Kherson region, imagine. place-- stayed hotel
lights stay off. entire town, lights off. navigate
darkness use phone shine, on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
terrible circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: exactly-- this-- can this?
element Athletic Greens? can function? No. think balanced
deep appreciation alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-
- mean, reason asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: reason ask get used creature comforts. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't need them, often come
depend way makes us feel like need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
quickly, something intensity life see people's
eyes living war makes forget creature
comforts. actually-- somebody hates traveling on. love
creature habits. love-- love comfort ritual right forgotten
quickly. Just intensity feeling, intensity love people
other, obvious. terms food-- curfew. depends part
country. usually, basically scamper home like 9:00 PM.
hard curfew lot places 11:00 PM night. then, home.
So-- places, 10:00. 9:00 PM, start going home. Which, me,
kind wonderful also get spend-- get forced spend time alone
think many hours wherever staying. really nice. everywhere
calmness quietness whole thing. terms food, day.
Just food incredibly cheap incredibly delicious. People still-- one
things can still take pride making best possible food can. meat--


admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can

used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

admire American meat, meat not great
country. ate borsch every day, kind stuff. Mostly meat. spend
entire day-- wake morning coffee, spend entire day talking people.
difficult intensity story. one
other. just talk regular people, talk soldiers, talk politicians, kinds
soldiers. talked people rescue missions, Americans. hung
Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? great Tim Kennedy. LEX
FRIDMAN: great Tim Kennedy, who-- also many others revealed one
many reasons proud American trained skilled effective
American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guess listeners podcast
maybe familiarize Tim Kennedy realized
number will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: that? try
summarize man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. can accurate not
exhaustive, good data accurate not exhaustive. skilled
accomplished MMA fighter, skilled accomplished former Special Operations
member, American Patriot, podcaster too, right? podcast?
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: know Andy Stumpf podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: amazing podcast. Yeah,
Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast Andy Stumpf.
LEX FRIDMAN: also Tim Kennedy like embodiment America
beautiful ridiculous degree. like imagine-- it,
Team America? just imagine shirtless tank rolling enemy territory just
screaming top lungs. just personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not posturing. actually work, say. LEX FRIDMAN:
thing. really embodies that. Now, just personality humor.
like sort comment humor things, not just him. one
interesting thing learned. also actually helping people extremely
good does, building teams rescue, go
dangerous areas Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, get job done.
one things heard time time again, really interesting me,
Ukrainian soldiers said comparing Ukrainian, Russian, American soldiers,
American soldiers bravest, interesting hear given
high morale Ukrainian soldiers. just reveals training enables


brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American
army, not just technology, especially special force guys. still one
effective terrifying armies world. listen, just context,
somebody is, part, anti-war, pacifist. get see
realities war kind wake needs get done protect sovereignty,
protect values, protect civilians homes kind stuff.
Sometimes war happen. also mention Russian side
haven't gotten experience Russian side yet fully plan travel
Russia, told everybody. upfront everybody this. like
hear story Russians. know Ukrainian side, like grandmas--
love grandmas. told stories Russians really-- ones entered
villages, really, really believed saving Ukraine Nazis, Nazi
occupation. feel Ukraine control Nazi organizations
believe saving country brothers sisters. think propaganda
think truth difficult thing arrive war zone. think 21st
century one things realize much war, even past,
information war. people just use Twitter source information
might surprised know much misinformation Twitter, like real
narratives sold, really hard know believe.
try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

brave. not just well trained on,
intense ferocious fighting. makes realize, American

try keep open mind ultimately ignore powerful listen
actual citizens, actual people. maybe obvious lesson war
waged powerful, rich people, poor people suffer. just
visible time time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mentioned fact people
still enjoy food pleasure cooking, occasional humor maybe
frequent humor. know Jocko Willink talked warfare
elements human spirit condition still emerge various times. find
amazing, conversations before, aperture
mind. classic story comes mind one Viktor Frankl Nelson
Mandela. put somebody small box confinement people break
conditions people find entire stories within centimeter
concrete can occupy them, real stories richness humor love fascination
surprise. find interesting mind adaptable. talked
creature comforts lack creature comforts way can adapt,


yet, humans always striving, seems, one hope, better conditions
better conditions. come back-- now back
States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold

sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

States long trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends podcast release
felt like never left, practically speaking, couple months. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. won't shy. recording mid-September.
LEX FRIDMAN: actually recorded several years ago anticipating
future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

many people say happy back. know not
going first last trip, will others, going
Russia well presumably places well order explore.


say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

say, podcaster friend, really inspired sense adventure
sense not just adventure, thoughtful, respectful adventure.
understood doing. weren't just going get wartime
footage something. wasn't kick thrill. really serious remains
serious. thank it, please, next time go, bring Tim Kennedy
again. LEX FRIDMAN: feel like Tim Kennedy gets into-- will take
really loves going dangerous places helping people. think get
trouble worth. mention that, mean, many
reasons went, definitely not something take lightly want again.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: things don't want
do, just feel like to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: compelled. LEX FRIDMAN:
don't think there's-- now definitely talk it, should. different
areas world seeing lot suffering. Yemen. many atrocities
going world today, one just personal want to-- feel like
qualified just language. talking, way, doing,
Russian. language, history, felt like
particular thing. think it's, many ways, stupid dangerous,
made clear me. many things nature heart pulls towards
that. also freedom not-- afraid death, think freedom
to-- almost like, OK, die, want take full advantage not family
currently. feel like family responsibility others
immediately become conservative careful. feel like want take full
advantage particular moment life can little bit
accepting risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, definitely reproduce
point. Maybe next time just freeze sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: ice
baths? works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: know, interesting.
always opportunity science protocols. know products
internet, actually decent manuscripts looking cold
exposure can increase testosterone levels, doesn't happen cold directly.
Good scientists, authors papers, are, realized
vasoconstriction vasodilation. people warm increased
blood flow testicles, women seems probably increased blood flow
reproductive organs well people warm back up. seems cause


sort hyper nourishment various cells, Sertoli Leydig cells
testes lead increased output testosterone women testosterone well.
cold exposure case obviously a-- ice bath?
that? LEX FRIDMAN: not done yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Russian
probably consider hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. nice thing
fun every warm up. No, haven't done that. kind
waiting maybe together point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX
FRIDMAN: seen Joe's. Joe set really nice man cave-- not
even cave big. like network man caves. ice bath
sauna next other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here, ice
bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.


absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

LEX FRIDMAN: guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one here.
It'll straightforward you. always say adrenaline comes waves,
just think walls, like going number walls adrenaline
opposed going time, becomes rather trivial. jujitsu background
immediately recognize physiological sensation. Even though cold
specifically, adrenaline makes want hop thing. LEX

bath sauna. get one days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although
a-- don't know underlying physiological basis seem
trend toward truth telling sauna. people will refer truth barrels.
Mine's barrel sauna shaped like barrel. knows why? Maybe intense heat
duress people just feel compelled share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, complicated
relationship saunas weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
LEX FRIDMAN: deepest suffering-- sorry interrupt-- done
sauna. very-- mean, gone dark places sauna because, mean,
wrestled whole life, judo, jujitsu, weights cuts can really test mind.
you're-- truth telling. Yeah, certain kind truth telling sitting
clock moves slower ever moved life. Yeah. usually,
part, try bunch sweats, garbage bags, kind
stuff, run. easier can distract mind. sauna can't
distract mind. just excuses weaknesses mind just
coming surface, just sitting sweating-- not sweating.
worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk visual aperture. small box
also inspires claustrophobia even not claustrophobic.

fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid

no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy

way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

absolutely true. desire just get thing get pretty
serious adrenaline surge sauna well. Now, sauna actually will-- won't
deplete testosterone kills sperm. people that-- sperm 60 day sperm
cycle trying donate sperm-- got us this--
fertilize egg eggs whatever format, dish vivo, say science,
means-- well, can look up, folks. 60 day sperm cycle. go really
hot sauna hot bath hot tub, 60 days sperm going be--
significantly greater portion will dead, will non-viable. simple
solution. People just put ice pack jar, not jar, jar cold fluid
legs just sit there, go back forth ice bath
sauna. probably-- going go back freeze
sperm. going couple episodes fertility relatively inexpensive.
young probably now association autism
males get older. not strong one. significant still small contribution
autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: age don't sperm get wiser no?
no science back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, men can conceive healthy
children considerable age. case-- no, don't get wiser.
happens interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, little bit like maturation brain sense sperm
get much better swimming many get less good. Motility strong
correlate DNA sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: probably good time
announce selling sperm NFTs. wanted see much that--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding crypto wave.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, children, future children future children,
supposed jujitsu together since done one jujitsu class
strongly vested children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friendly kind way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind
way. Yeah. Dominance clan.

00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky

Yep. sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: moving science, still minds
Ukraine. encounter scientists see universities? know,
country Europe elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. need


buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.



01:13:05 InsideTracker

want stuff move fast, Twitter best medium communication that.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

buildings, need laboratories, need robots, need lot equipment,
need minus 80 freezers need incubators need money need
technicians. typically wealthier countries able
research sake research development prioritization. Certainly
Ukraine marvelous universities marvelous scientists. going
science scientists there? gosh, can even calculate loss
discovery occurring consequence conflict? LEX FRIDMAN:
science goes on. war Ukraine vibrant tech sector, means
engineering kind stuff, Kyiv lot excellent universities
still go on. biggest hit, say, not infrastructure science,
fact, high morale, everybody joining military. everybody going
front fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, fighting, not
want to. everybody know really
proud fighting, even though everyone tries convince, Andrew Huberman,
much better ways contribute. deep honor fighting country,
yes, better ways contribute country just picking gun
not trained going front. Still, it. Scientists,
engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men women? LEX
FRIDMAN: Actors-- men women. Obviously, primarily men, men women.
Much see militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody
wants fight. Everybody's proud fighting. no discussion pacifism.
fighting? right? this-- everybody's really proud fighting.
kind black hole pulls everything, resources, war effort not just
financial also psychological. like scientist feels like what-- feels
almost like dishonoring humanity continuing things
before. lot people converted soldiers. literally watch
YouTube video shoot particular gun, arm drone grenade.
tech person know work drones going use that, use
whatever skills got, figure whatever skills got use help
effort front. big hit. said, talked lot folks
Kyiv-- faculty primarily tech economics space, didn't get chance interact
folks biology, chemistry, neuroscience side things, still
goes on. one really impressive things Ukraine able
maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, kind stuff, education,


war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

war going on, especially Kyiv. war started nobody knew whether Kyiv
going taken Russian forces. surrounded. lot experts
outside convinced Russia take Kyiv, didn't. one
really impressive things leader-- one things really experienced
lot people criticized Zelenskyy war. 30% approval rate.
lot people didn't like Zelenskyy. one great things leader,
not sure many leaders able do, Kyiv clearly invaded
chose stay. stayed capital. Everybody, American military,
intelligence agencies, NATO, staff, advisors told flee, stayed.
think beacon, symbol rest, universities, science,
infrastructure staying too, kept whole thing going.
interesting social experiment happened, think folks interested gun
control country particular, one decisions made early give
guns everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early war? LEX
FRIDMAN: Early war, yeah. everybody got gun. also released
bunch prisoners prison no staff keep prisons running.
interesting psychological experiment of, like, going
go? Everybody gun. going start robbing places? going start
taking advantage chaotic situation? happened crime went zero.
turned this, experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
least hate not. don't know love sort lack initiative common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. don't-- right. think correct
say wasn't hate unifying people. love country, love
community. probably thing will happen humans aliens invade
well. common effort. Everybody puts everything else side. Plus just
sheer amount guns similar Texas. realize, well, going self-
correcting mechanism quickly rule law also put aside, right?
Basically police force lost lot power everybody else guns
kind taking law hands. system, least particular
case

00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization



particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

particular moment human history, worked. interesting lesson, know?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is. interesting contrast share
mentioned Texas. not long ago Austin. often visit
others Austin, know. many doors walked past, including school,
said no firearms past point. sticker door. see hospitals
sometimes. saw Baylor College Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
see Texas, not common California. flew San Francisco Bay
Area, walking elementary school old neighborhood, saw similar
sticker looked said, no peanuts allergy containing foods past
point door elementary school. quite different contrast, guns
peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, serious people, although
great research Stanford showing early exposure peanuts can
prevent allergies. don't start rubbing peanut butter, folks,
peanut allergy. not best way deal it. case, contrast
dangerous, contrast familiarity guns versus no familiarity. Israel
elsewhere see machine guns airport. Germany, Frankfurt, see machine
guns airport. Not common United States. again, feel like
aperture vision. aperture pleasures versus creature comforts lack
creature comforts, aperture danger, right? People
familiar guns familiar people coming setting firearm table
eating dinner, know? not accustomed jarring, right? LEX
FRIDMAN: mention-- people know throughout human history--
human ability get assimilated now, get used violence incredible.
living peaceful time, like now, one explosion, like
9/11 type situation. huge shock. terrifying. Everybody freaks out.
second one huge drop off freaked get. matter days,
sometimes hours, becomes normal. talked many people Kharkiv,
one towns seen lot heated battle. ask them, safe there?
fact, went the-- closer closer war zone ask people, safe?
answer's usually, yeah, pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: signal
noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody told except Western reporters sitting West
Side Ukraine, really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, good. uncle just
died yesterday. shot. pretty good. farm still running. put
it? focus positive, one. deeper truth there, just


get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

get used difficult situations stuff make happy stuff make
upset relative new normal establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
grew California lot earthquakes. remember '89 quake,
remember Embarcadero Freeway pancaking top people cars. remember
moved Southern California, Northridge quake. Wherever move
seem earthquakes. never worry earthquakes, ever. just don't. fact,
don't like destruction cause, every earthquake will roll
kind exciting. sounds like train coming through. like, wow, like
Earth moving. know? Again, don't want anyone get harmed, enjoy
good rumble coming nonetheless. signal noise. saw tornado
freak out, people Midwest probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable,
great wrestler Midwest know never met great
respect for, probably-- sees tornado like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic

know? think signal noise real. neglect, although won't forget,
speaking signal noise environment, returning gone back
one original natural habitats, Massachusetts Institute Technology
is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: actually
difficult pronounce full. MIT, right? spending time
teaching things. Tell us MIT recently. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, really glad you, West Coast, know difference
Boston, New York. feel like lot people think like East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: different, especially Bostonians New Yorkers.
LEX FRIDMAN: get aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh goodness.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, love it. gave lectures front person crowd.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: AI,
different aspects AI robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. people
know artificial intelligence field usually don't use term AI, people
outside AIs. biggest breakthroughs machine learning field
discussion robotics on. Yeah. person. wonderful. sucker
that. really avoided teaching kind interaction COVID
people put lot emphasis also got comfortable remote teaching,


think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

think nobody enjoyed it. Except notion much easier
don't travel. can pajamas kind thing. actually
get it, don't get kind joy teaching.
student don't get kind joy learning. not effective
kind stuff. person together people, see eyes, get
excitement, get questions interactions, awesome. still
sucker believer ideal MIT, University. think incredible
place. something air still. really hit-- pandemic hit universities
hard because-- can say this. not saying it. saying it.
administrations-- cases people criticize institutions, pandemic
given power administration taken away power faculty
students, everybody involved, including administration.
concern university teachers students.
primary. whenever pandemic opportunity increase
amount rules. One things really bothered me, scream top
MIT dome, instituted new temp ticket system.
visitor campus MIT, register. to, first all, show
vaccinated, importantly, process visiting. need
get permission visit. One reasons loved MIT, unlike institutions,
MIT just leaves door open anyone. classrooms can roll ridiculous
characters. students usually business stuff economics can roll
physics class just-- kind not allowed gray area let
happen, creates flourishing community beautiful. think
adding extra rules puts squeeze limits flourishing, hope
dissipates time kind let go risk aversion created
pandemic. kind enter normal return back flourishing can
happen. actually students, magic. love it. love
it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, earliest videos YouTube channel
classroom, right? started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Yeah. YouTube-- putting stuff YouTube terrifying, right? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, especially time it. Again, pioneer
sense. that, Jordan Peterson that. Putting lectures is-- yeah. teach still.
Every winter teach-- direct course, even teaching going
forward. idea videos web is-- yeah, spikes cortisol


little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.



01:13:05 InsideTracker

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. terrifying get-- everybody
different experience. junior research scientist kind natural concern
like, I? giving lecture like, don't deserve this.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: humility coming through, actually think
humility part instructor good think
entitled, else give lecture? worry more. heard-- don't
know still true-- Caltech, great California Institute Technology not far
here, many faculty actually afraid students. Not physically
afraid, intellectually afraid students smart. teaching
can downright frightening, heard. great. Keeps everybody
toes. know, corrected lecture Stanford elsewhere.
lab UC San Diego someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture
said now said that-- podcast. know? think
moment sometimes feel urge defend go, oh, right,
think depends one trained. graduate advisor wonderful saying,
don't know, time. went Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, Caltech.
Brilliant woman. no problem saying, don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
problem either. usually two guys somebody speaks up, grab them,
drag room, never see again. everybody really supportive.
don't understand amount love support get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Especially last students everybody seems nodding
going. No, think love sit-in one lectures. know little
AI, machine learning, robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: ever talked
MIT? ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. went
job market faculty member final two choices MIT Picower--
on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place neuroscience. UC
San Diego, wonderful neuroscience program. end made sense
West Coast personal reasons, amazing neuroscience
going there. Goodness. always true going continue.
long time since invited back there. Oddly enough started
podcasting-- still run lab shrunk lab considerably done
podcasting-- received fewer academic lecture invites, makes sense. now
sort coming back. people invite now always say, want
talk ventral thalamus role anxiety aggression


want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

want talk podcast? big fear going go back give
lecture retina something start off Athletic Greens read
something like just reflexively. Just kidding. wouldn't happen. listen, think
great continue keep foot places. happy hear
teaching MIT podcasting one thing, teaching another,
overlap Venn diagram. listen, students get sit-in one
lectures-- may see sitting audience soon creep
class. LEX FRIDMAN: sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Wearing
red shirt. won't recognize me. certainly receiving great gift.

01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media

watched lectures YouTube, even early ones, listen, know
phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, something about-- also
doing-- stayed pretty late last night working deadline paper. One
things hope hopefully rest life continue publishing,
think really important even continue podcast want
just intellectual scientific journey podcasting. least
me, especially engineering side want build stuff, think
keeps ego check, keeps humble think talk much
microphone start getting-- might lose track grounding comes
engineering science scientific process criticisms get,
kind stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: slow iterative is.
two papers right now revision stage, long road.
asked recently met chairman. said, want
continue run lab just going go full time podcast? Stanford
supportive, must say, know MIT you. said, oh,
absolutely want continue involved research research.
start talking papers looking my-- yearly review
looking back like, goodness, papers play long time.
long road learn more, time spend
myopically looking bunch data learn think. totally
agree. Talking devices podcasts wonderful fun. relieves
certain itch hopefully lands important information


people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.



01:13:05 InsideTracker

want stuff move fast, Twitter best medium communication that.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

people, research the-- guess know, know.
unpeeling onion, knowing something there. just
nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: mean, do-- especially pandemic.
me, Twitter podcast made much impatient
slowness review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will that.
LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. even podcast cool-- find
something cool ideas just say pretty
quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: post right now something
found interesting world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: can write
something, like culture computer science posting stuff arXiv
preprints don't get annual review, sometimes don't even go
review process ever people just start using code. like,
point this? works. self evident works people using it,
think applies engineering fields actual tool works.
doesn't matter if-- don't scientifically prove works. works
using lot people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry interrupt, just--
point reference, famous paper describing double helix earned Watson
Crick Nobel Prize earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too,
course, got structure DNA course. paper never reviewed
Nature. published importance self evident, whatever.
decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: purely
editorial decision, believe. mean, told someone currently
editor Nature. turns not correct someone will tell us comments
sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty interesting,
right? LEX FRIDMAN: really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps
significant discovery biology bioengineering leading
bioengineering well, course, last century not peer reviewed. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- Eric Weinstein, many others talked this,
is, mean, don't think people understand poor peer review process is. Just
amount of-- think peer review means best peers get together
review stuff, unpaid work usually small number people.
select perspective might not best person, especially
super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: time it. bunch
editorial boards still. Why, don't know, enjoy peer review process


sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days

different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love

cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

sending papers out. Oftentimes best scientists busy don't time
review. oftentimes premiere journals will select kind unique kit
good scientists close work, sometimes people
far work. really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: negatives, right?
close work jealousy, basic human things. far
work might not appreciate nuanced contribution, kind stuff.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychology. Sorry interrupt again, good
friend mine extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator,
et cetera, always told they-- won't even say whether not are.
select reviewers basis publishing well recently
assume person going benevolent
well love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: good point
that, actually. idea editors might actually best reviewers,
traditional-- thing wanted mention Eric Weinstein talks about,
back several decades ago editors much power. something
made editors ones responsible crafting
journal. really invested this, also often experts, right? makes
sense editor bit power case. Usually idea truly novel
see it, makes sense editor power regard.
course me, think peer review done way tweets done,
crowdsourced Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let crowd decide. LEX
FRIDMAN: Let crowd decide, let crowd add depth breadth context
contribution. paper overstates degree contribution, crowd will
check that. not enough support conclusions not supported
evidence, crowd will check that. be, course, political
bickering enters picture, especially controversial topics, think trust
intelligence human beings figure out. think us trying
figure whole process out. just wish happening much faster
important topics, review cycle faster. learned COVID
Twitter actually pretty effective science communication. really
interesting. best scientists took Twitter communicate work
people's work, always putting caveats not peer reviewed
on, data just moves fast.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman, use code Huberman checkout.
now Twitter regularly, initially just Instagram. remember
used dinner drink conversations say, don't
understand Twitter. say, don't understand Instagram. course,
understand worked work respective platform, think
trying figure driving psychology different venues
quite distinct psychologies whatever reason. think finally starting
understand Twitter enjoy little bit. Initially wasn't prepared level
reflexive scrutiny. sounds little bit oxymoronic, people pick one small
thing drive trajectory. didn't seem happening quite much
Instagram, love tweets. question Twitter account
you-- sort internal filters put won't put up?


sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not

Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.

else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.

green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:

real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.

sometimes put things life reflections. times
put things like excited AI, course, point various
podcasts including own, others well. approach social media?
Not regulate behavior terms much time, et cetera.
know talked before. know, mindset around social
media go either post forage respond information? LEX
FRIDMAN: think try add some-- not sound cliche, love
world into, OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. think viral negativity
can take hold, try find right language add good vibes there.
actually really, really tricky something positivity sounds
fake. can't quite put finger it, whenever talk love positive
almost childlike curiosity positivity, people start think, surely
skeletons closet. dead bodies basement. must fake--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, attic. LEX FRIDMAN: attic? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: attic. LEX FRIDMAN: keep mine basement. details.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: referring attic. don't attic basement,
dead bodies. just want clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. attic
actually haven't there. Maybe bodies there. yes, prefer
basement. colder there. like it. No, assumption
not genuine disingenuous kind way. try find right
language kind stuff, positive. really inspired
Elon's approach Twitter. Not it, just silly. found silliness--
think Hermann Hesse said something paraphrase-- one favorite writers--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: think Steppenwolf said, learn
taken seriously laugh rest. think try silly, laugh myself,
laugh absurdity life, part serious, try just positive, just
see positive perspective. also, said, people pick certain words
attack other, attack certain usage words particular
tweet. think thing try think positively towards them, like not escalate.
whenever somebody's criticizing on, just smile. lesson
learned, learn just send good vibes way. Don't respond, just
hopefully, karma ripple effect positivity, impact
rest Twitter. find builds-- actions create
community. behave gets surrounded certain people. lately,


especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

especially Ukraine one topic like this, also thought talking to-- somebody
reached Andrew Tate, extremely controversial. perspective
lot people misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: heard name
know lot controversy around him. Maybe familiarize me.
pretty nose podcast prep tried vacation thing
three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: heard that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
sort worked. get time Colorado wilderness myself,
great. get downtime. event, mainly consisted reading and-
- LEX FRIDMAN: nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading nature, sauna, ice
bath, working out, good food, little extra sleep, kinds things really felt
needed it. pretty naive comes kind current controversies
heard name, think deplatformed couple platforms.
right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, been-- also admit
might know you, not much. like five-year-old talking four-
year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: athlete, podcaster? LEX
FRIDMAN: basic summary, used fighter, kickboxer, believe. pretty
successful. think reality show,
programs basically pickup artist advice. community
people gives advice pick women, successful
relationships, make lot money, costs money enter programs.
lot criticism gets kind of-- like pyramid scheme
convince people join can make money convince
others join, kind stuff. not interested talking him.
interested one guests-- maybe mention who, one
female guests had, really big scientist, said two kids 13 12 really
look Andrew entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: male children, female
children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. hear time time again. somebody
lot teens, young teens, look to. haven't done serious research. usually
try avoid research agree talk go deep. aspect
way talks women that, understand understand certain
dynamics relationships work people one person, think
really disrespectful towards women not I-- not see means
good man. conversation want masculinity.
masculinity mean 21st century? think kind


stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

stuff, talking Twitter, like going war zone. happy
go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: like, send Ukraine,
don't want conversation Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: really,
really, really tricky one also, know, podcast, everybody
wants win. everything positive. Maybe say wrong thing
inaccurate thing can correct yourself. Andrew Tate, Donald Trump,
folks like this, to-- mean, professional boxing. think
push person. really eloquent. also empathetic
can't just journalists do, talk person entire
time. easy. hard thing empathize person, understand them,
steel man case, also make case. case
means man, strong man somebody respectful women. Not
weakness, not social justice warrior signaling, kind stuff,
strong man does. don't need disrespectful prove
position life. often-- now, lot people say character.
misogynistic. misogynist kind of-- entertainment purposes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: like avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. me, avatar
lot influence young folks character impact. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, don't think can separate avatar person terms
impact, said. fact, number accounts Twitter
Instagram elsewhere people revealed first names give
themself another name using cartoon image. part that, believe,
least individuals actually know are, understand
attempt maintain privacy, important many people. cases
can inflammatory just pop elsewhere something
else without anyone knowing person. LEX FRIDMAN: of--
dark stuff. reading lot Ukraine Nazi Germany, '30s
'40s on, get see much absurdity turns evil quickly. One
things worry-- one things really don't like see Twitter
internet many statements end LOL. like think just something
kind funny funny legitimately funny, also doesn't deep effect
society. difficult gray area best comedy dark
mean, reveals important truth need consider. sometimes
comedy just covering destructive ideology, know line


two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

two. Hitler seen joke late '20s '30s Nazi
Germany joke became serious. careful know
difference joke reality that. mean, conversation--
just big believer conversation able reveal something
conversation, don't know. One big-- challenge
time. don't know takes good, empathetic, adversarial
conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: need learn Tate person,

01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes

not learn them. Yeah. sounds like maybe something skip. don't know
because, again, not familiar content. going ask whether
not seeked whether not ever consider Donald Trump
guest podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, talked Joe lot
really believe can good conversation Donald Trump, haven't seen
many good conversations him. part thinks-- part believes
possible, often effectively runs interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sit down, give element Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio got
different side might come out. Context powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good this, relaxing person. Like here, drink. Smoke joint,
whatever is. energy just, relax, laughter on. don't
think-- people know, just not good kind stuff. think way
good conversation really understand worldview, able steel
man worldview support him. is, sorry say people
seem hate Donald Trump, large percentage country.
really empathize people. empathize Donald Trump,
human being, perspective, ask hard questions. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think counterpoint going seek balance
guests. going Trump on, on? LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems
strongly associated counter values, least eye public. think
retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, retiring. really interesting,
Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, don't think counterbalance.


complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

complicated, fascinating figure seems attracted lot hate distrust,
also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. LEX FRIDMAN:
love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love people. mean, know people, not
even necessarily scientists, pro-Fauci shirts. seen people anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, adore him. people adore
way people adore Trump. interesting one species
animal get divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: almost feels like
design every single topic find tension division fascinating watch.
mean, got really witness zero hundred Ukraine, not
huge significant division. certain parts Ukraine, across Europe,
across world not much division Russia Ukraine,
just born overnight, intense hatred. see kind stuff Fauci
pandemic. first huddled uncertainty. togetherness
pandemic. course, difficult isolated.
start figure out-- probably politicians media try figure out, can
take side can now start reporting side side say
side wrong? think Anthony Fauci part just used
scapegoat certain things part kind narrative division. think--
Trump singular figure that, me, represents something important American
history. not sure is, think think-- put historian
hat, go forward time, think back. will remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years
now? opposite that? to-- really think
Trump singular. think AOC interesting one,
young unclear know how-- represents legitimately large scale movement
not. Bernie Sanders interesting option, wish 30, 40 years
younger. young Bernie good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
scientists working that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. never know.
big conspiracy theory Putin is-- body double. no longer him.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: hard time merging image. LEX FRIDMAN:
conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. Putin see camera today body
double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing science, particular,
anatomy, classification scheme different types anatomists,


either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

either say lumper splitter. people like call whole structure
something, not necessarily just simplicity lot reasons.
people like microdivide nucleus multiple names. course, people used
able name different brain structures themselves.
nucleus Lex Huberman vesiculus whatever. Less nowadays.
way, structures don't actually exist just yet. haven't defined yet.
making names up. interesting seems like last five years,
lot trend-- trend, excuse me, toward requirement
lumping. can't say-- seems not allowed, will, say, hey, yeah,
know-- not stating my-- will never reveal preferences pandemic
related things hopefully obvious reasons. people will say vaccines, yes,
masks, no. vaccines masks, yes, let people work. people will say,
no, everyone stay home. people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let
everybody work. No one saying no vaccines, no masks, stay home, don't
think. sort lumping, right? boundaries around ideology really
start defy science. mean, wasn't scientific. one part science-ish times
sometimes really hardcore science. times politics, economics. mean,
really saw confluence different domains society use different
criteria evaluate world. mean, scientist, remember vaccines first
came asked somebody, one early concerns actually
satisfied was, thing turn off? start generating mRNA,
actually get turned off? asked friend, know lot RNA biology.
said, know, turn off? explained like, OK,
makes sense. asked questions. people aren't going think
level detail necessarily, seem just kind amorphous
blobs ideology grabbed things need
chasm them. almost felt like became illegal, ways, want two
things menu one things menu. really felt like
constrained kind like Bento box model didn't get define
Bento box. either Bento box Bento box Z, nothing
between. LEX FRIDMAN: think topic think lot topics, people
middle humility, uncertainty, just kind trying figure out.
think just extremes defining nature division. think
role lot us individual lives, also platform kind,


think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

think try walk middle empathy humility.
actually science humility. still thinking opposite
Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe none. mean, maybe Fauci
orthogonal Trump. mean, not everything opposite. mean, maybe n
1 maybe minority one outsider Washington
made there. LEX FRIDMAN: also wonder-- pick battles
every battle fight

01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status

take seriously. just amount hate get, got, still get
sat Pfizer CEO, valuable lesson me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, one got lot heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, still
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: pretty controversial guests
time time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: still
Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn
like crazy. thing didn't realize. science somebody moves institutions
big deal. people don't two moves career, maybe.
often move next building big deal. biotech-- like former
colleague mine San Diego CEO here, CEO there.
went back company CEO before. probably back university
worked know. amazing much moving around there.
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, think they're-- certain companies, guess
biotech case, CEO like manager type can--
jumping around benefits experience become better better
manager. leader revolutionary CEOs stick around longer
critical pivoting company, like Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk somebody like part pivoting
company new domains constantly, yeah. biotech machine.
eyes lot people, big pharma like big tobacco. epitome everything
wrong capitalism. evil, right? showed conversation
thought pretty open mind really asked thought difficult questions
him. don't think ever sat grilling kind. fact, pretty sure
cut interview short that, thought literally hot room


sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

sweating asking tough questions. somebody half
country large percent country believes alleviated lot of-- helped,
financial resources Pfizer has, helped alleviate lot suffering
world. thought somebody like that, asking pretty hard questions. Boy,
get hear side-- usually one sides intense anger.
certain political topics-- like Andrew Tate, example, hear
very-- probably left, far left, write angrily.
group hear from. Pfizer CEO, didn't get almost messages
people saying, go hard him? incredible human, incredible
leader CEO company helped us vaccine nobody thought
possible develop quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not get letters
sort? LEX FRIDMAN: not. mean, there, sea people
said everything weak wasn't able call person,
sit down, platform evil person, make look human,
kind stuff. deal that. to-- course, great.
great soul searching, like, I? ask
hard questions. love criticism like that. get to-- low points.
definitely despair start wonder, weak?
talked him? true? sit alone just marinate that. Hopefully
time makes better, still don't know right answer one
is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, feel money plays role here. people think
big pharma, think billions dollars-- maybe even trillions dollars, really.
certainly people make lot money get scrutiny others don't. Part
often not always visible, think natural reflexive--
not justifying it. certainly don't feel know people
wealthy, people poor. can't say scales happiness all.
People always shocked hear that, observed wealthy
people. people lot money often held different standard
people resent that, people resent that, maybe
reasons well. mean, among people wealthy, oftentimes wish
status, right? Not money. get bunch billionaires room, unless one
Elon, also immense status accomplishments, typically put
Nobel Prize winner room bunch billionaires talking
person. Right? many interesting billionaires. status something


often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

often not always associated money, much rarer form
uniqueness there, positive uniqueness-- one considers status positive
downside to. wonder whether not Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
people assume, probably assume also, salary quite immense.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. lot data this. can answer it.
good hypothesis. test scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tell
great hypothesis wrong. know smirk. know smirk. LEX
FRIDMAN: honestly think wrong. effect lot people, think
distrust not towards CEO. distrust towards company. One
really difficult soul searching do, just interact Pfizer folks
every level, junior CEO, really nice people. mission.
talk trying really help people best way make money
come medicine helps lot people. mission clear.
good people, lot really brilliant people, PhDs. can system
people good, including CEO. good, mean people really
trying everything. dedicate whole life good. yet,
think system can deviate path good start
deceive good, turn game money come
play company perspective convince money
make, good able do. start focus
making money, can really deviate lose track
actually good. not saying necessarily Pfizer that, think companies
that. can apply criticism social media companies, big pharma
companies. One big lessons me-- don't know answer is,
people inside company can good, people want hang with,
people want work with, company evil. possibility.
distrust don't think towards billionaire individual, see lot
case. think Wall Street distrust, machinery particular organization
gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: generalization hate again. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. good luck figuring true. tough stuff.
say individuals-- individual scientists NIH Pfizer just
incredible people. really brilliant people. never trust administration
business people-- no offense, business people. scientists always good.
right motivator life. again, can blinders on. focused


science. Nazi Germany history people just focused science
politicians use scientists achieve whatever end want. just look
narrowly journey scientist, beautiful one ultimately
curiosity, moment discovery versus money. mean, prestige probably
come play later life, especially young scientists. the-- like
pulling threat curiosity try discover something big. get excited
kind stuff, beautiful see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful see.
former graduate student, now postdoc Caltech, don't even know
cell phone. come lab, put cell phone desk,
tremendously productive. wasn't brought up. productive
side effect just absolutely committed obsessed discover answers
questions asking best could, was-- feel it.
just feel intensity, just incredibly low activation energy.

01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups

experiment just go it. teaching MIT.
obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem
proclivity finding guests controversial, right? thinking Tate,
talking Trump, talking Pfizer CEO, talking Fauci.
intense people. getting folks a-- not
neuroimaging traditional sense putting someone scanner.
using, great Karl Deisseroth, podcast--
LEX FRIDMAN: Thank that. Thank connecting us. incredible
person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, human
writer, conversation phenomenal. listened twice.
actually taken notes. talk household. really do.
description love not missed, just leave that, try say
won't capture well. getting language based map least portion Lex


Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

obviously traveling world, right podcast lot coverage chess
recently, interesting. don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh,
scientific questions that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. get
sure. then-- LEX FRIDMAN: not going like it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. also very-- spell Massachusetts
again? LEX FRIDMAN: course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also still seem

Fridman's brain here. else going days brain relates
robotics, AI? last conversation lot robots potential robot-
human interaction. Even robot, et cetera. still working robots
focused robots, science showing life besides things
already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: think last time talked
Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. just leave. LEX FRIDMAN:
Yes. mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: went on. like, know,
might last-- said wanted come after. like,
come before. want see go. flesh.
LEX FRIDMAN: lot of-- just lot mind occupied, obviously,
part world. difficult struggles still going
haven't launched company want launch company AI.
mean, maybe longer conversation, ultimate dream put robots every
home. short term see possibility launching social media company,
nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

nontrivial explanation leads robots home. basically
algorithms fuel effective social robotics, robots can form deep
connection with. really-- yeah, building prototypes
struggling don't maybe, critical, guts launch company.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, combined. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think got guts. mean, clear interview
Pfizer CEO considering putting Tate fellow podcast
gone Ukraine guts. means not quite lot
things. LEX FRIDMAN: mean. take-- thing is, many people
know, fill day busy, busyness becomes excuse
use things scare you. lot people use family way.
know, wife, kids, can't. reality successful people
wife kids families still it. lot times
can fill day busy work, with-- yeah, course, podcasts kind
stuff. make happy all-- wonderful research,
teaching, on. can just serve excuse thing
heart says right thing do, don't guts, guts
say no basically everything focus out. part
unlikely fail anything life currently already found comfortable
place. startup mostly going be-- likely going failure, not


embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, machine learning data
aware of-- don't know lot machine learning, within realm
neuroscience, say failure rate 15% optimal neuroplasticity
growth. Whether not translates kinds practices isn't clear, getting trials
right 85% time seems optimal language learning, seems optimal
mathematics, seems optimal physical pursuits average, right? sure
going-- machine learning geeks listen podcast listen
podcast, doesn't mean fail 15% weight sets, folks.
mean, 16%. No, just kidding. not exact, pretty good rule
thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: think lot startup founders literally murder 85%
chance success. think given opportunities have, skill set, funding,
kind stuff, chances relatively high success. relatively high
means startup world still far, far 85. talking single digit
percentages. startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, think means--
decision focus company not things means decision close
hatch dopamine retrieval things predictable
sources dopamine. Not everything dopamine, dopamine is, think,
primary chemical driver motivation. know can get degree
satisfaction scrolling social media particular cup coffee,
going do. going consume unless somehow invert
algorithm say, actually denial drinking coffee going
dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
beauty forebrain can make decisions.
essence, believe, see David Goggins. much there.
person none us know knows, course. idea
pain source dopamine. limbic friction, sometimes like call it,
source dopamine. runs counter nervous systems work,
decision based, right? not musculature certain way
CRISPR something. decides that. think amazing,
means terms starting company changing priorities closing hatch
many current sources dopamine can derive dopamine
failures within narrow context, reductionist view
neurocentric view talking about. think lot. mean,
decision choose one relationship versus another decision close


opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

opportunities, right? think decision order one thing off menu versus
others decision close hatches. think absolutely
can it. just question of, can flip algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
Remap source dopamine something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
maybe go not succeed make the-- journey destination type
thing, financially vested time-- far know, get
one life, least planet want spend wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN:
lot people surround you-- people really important, don't
people around say start up. difficult find people
because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Austin big startup culture right now? LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah, is. is. doesn't make sense startup.
people love whole life telling me, doesn't make sense
right now. Just thing previously.

01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships

ANDREW HUBERMAN: get sense saying
apt go them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, never that, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, need-- talked people love, parents, family, on, friends.
one people needs unconditional support difficult things. know
coaching wise good-- get coached best. say wrestling.
like coach says, want win Olympics? will not-- say want win
gold medal Olympics freestyle wrestling want coach doesn't blink
hears believes can it, viciously intense cruel
pursuit. want this, this. Right? support.
positivity, don't-- never-- not energized, see love, person
saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, old win Olympic gold medal,
right? things can come with. not helpful can't find
dopamine, haven't yet, dopamine source haters. Basically people
criticizing you, trying prove wrong. never got off. never-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Whereas people seem like that. mean, David Goggins seems
come mind. seems driven many sources. access-- don't know
never asked him, venture guess, say probably
lot options inside head push challenge. Not just overcome


pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

pain, post sometimes fact people will say people will
talk pushback approach. also talk pushback approach
purely internal doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX
FRIDMAN: Yeah. literally like voice yells represents kind devil
wants fail, calls bitch kinds things saying, know,
fuck you. not. always enemy going enemy. mean,
wish-- maybe something. mean, really interesting. Maybe can remap
way can construct-- kind obvious mechanism. Construct
amorphous blob hater wants fail, right? kind David
Goggins thing. blob says weak, dumb, old,
fat, whatever, getting want quit on.
start getting angry blob, maybe good motivator. haven't
personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, external challenge
postdoc, prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories,
fact, working thing was, just lowly postdoc
working project pretty independent lab in. competition
plenty room everybody win, head-- frankly, won't
disclose is. legitimate competition
little bit friction-- not much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, might pushed
extra hours more, little bit. say, felt metabolizing. felt catabolic,
right? couldn't sustained it. contrast podcast work
laboratory now focused stress human performance, et cetera,
pure love. pure curiosity love. mean, hard days, never--
no adversary picture. practical workings life that-- LEX
FRIDMAN: thing Joe really inspired on, people create
adversarial relationships podcasting get-- YouTubers this. hate
seeing somebody else successful. feeling jealousy, people
even see healthy. Mr. Beast somebody, popular YouTubers,
get 100 million views get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted entire-- according him, entire life focused
becoming massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, inspiring
many ways, people become famous much less insane
pursuit greatness Mr. Beast. People become famous social media
on, easy jealous them. One early things learned Joe just


fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter

wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still

tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone

cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

fan podcast much celebrated everybody. again, maybe
ruined whole dopamine thing don't get energized people become
popular. podcasting space YouTube, doesn't-- awesome.
awesome inspired that. problem not good motivator.
Inspiration like, oh, cool, humans can this. beautiful. not--
looking. looking forcing function. gave away salary MIT.
hoping bank account zero. forcing function like, oh
shit. know? not allowed normal job, wanted launch--
podcast becomes source income. like, goddammit. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, confess biases. good
realm podcast-- excellent things well,
just less experience things. know taking liberty speaking
many, many people just saying, sure hell hope don't shut
podcast. friend somebody cares deeply
happiness deeper satisfaction, heart's heart company, well
then, damn it, company. LEX FRIDMAN: lot wouldn't even categorize
happiness. don't know things like life, probably
happiest possibly right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful. LEX
FRIDMAN: thing longing start nothing
happiness. something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: itch. itch.
LEX FRIDMAN: pretty sure less happy really tough process.
mean, whatever degree can extract happiness struggle, yes, maybe.
don't see it. think very, low points. lot people find
companies-- found companies know about. also want relationship, want
get married, sure hell startup not going increase likelihood that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: start family start company. LEX
FRIDMAN: Well, a-- huge believer that, get relationship
low point life, is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. not
disputing stance, agreeing it. just every
Lex Fridmanism hits particular circuit brain. just laugh loud.
LEX FRIDMAN: just think easy relationship everything good.
relationships become strong tested quickly

02:01:55 Jobs; Career vs. Calling; Robotics & Relationships



ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger

streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

ones shit going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, hope
yet. sat conversation podcast producer,
a-- wouldn't say avid, rather rabid consumer podcasts finds
amazing podcasts, small podcasts unique episodes. Anyway, talking
stuff seen read business sector, talking
difference job, career, calling, right? think extracting
conversations CEOs founders, et cetera. forget specific founders
brought light him. idea focus job can make
income, hopefully enjoy job not hate much. career represents
sort of, mind, kind series evolutions one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. calling whole level energetic pull
includes career job includes concept life. hard
draw line calling career calling parts life.
question, therefore, is, feel calling start company
compulsion irritates you? something wish go away something
hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, hope won't go away. calling.
calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: like
see robot-- first interacted robots, became even stronger
sophisticated robots interacted, see magic there. like, look
around, anyone else see magic? kind like maybe fall love,
like feeling. anyone else notice person just walked room? feel
way robots, can elaborate means not even sure can
convert words. just feel like social integration robots society will create
really interesting world. ability anthropomorphize look robot
ability feel things look robot something us don't yet
experience, think everybody will experience next decades. just
want part exploring hasn't really thoroughly explored.
best roboticists world not currently working problem all. try
avoid human beings completely, nobody's really working problem terms
look numbers. big tech companies investing money,
closest thing Alexa basically servant help tell weather
play music on. not trying form deep connection. sometimes
just notice thing. Not notice magic. gut feeling, try not


speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real

02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,

work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

speak no track record, feel like can good bringing
magic robot. no data says good that,
feeling. just feeling. done many things-- love playing
guitar, kind stuff, jujitsu. never felt feeling. jujitsu
don't feel magic genius required extremely good. guitar don't feel
that. noticed others, great musicians, notice magic
thing ran it. just always thought-- think different
form knew robots existed, existed. form magic
humans. think love, smile two friends towards
really young. people excited first know
notice other, moment share feeling
together. like, wow, really interesting. really interesting two
separate intelligent organisms able connect sudden deep emotional
level. like, huh. just beautiful see, notice magic that.
started programming-- programming, period, programming AI systems,
realize, oh, be-- not just humans humans.
humans entities, dogs, cats, robots. I-- reason hit
intensely saw robots. yeah, calling. calling can
just enjoy vision it, vision future world, exciting future world full
cool stuff, can part building that. part building means
hard work capitalism, like raising funds people, me, right
now, easy part, hiring lot people. don't know much know
hiring, hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX
FRIDMAN: Excellent people will define trajectory not company,
whole existence human being. building up, not failing
now depend you, not failing world opportunity bring
something brings joy people. pressure, just non-stop fires
put out. drama, work people never worked like
lawyers human resources supply chain. compute
heavy, computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity,
dealing people's data. now understand not cybersecurity
data privacy, maintain privacy correctly data, also
psychology people trusting data. how, look Mark
Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey folks, seem hated large number


people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less
so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think always think Jack loved individual, but--
LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, positive view world, yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like Jack lot like mind I-- someone close described
recently excellent listener. said Jack,
experience too. private person leave that. listen,
think Jack Dorsey one greats last 200 years just much quieter
stance things lot people. much see world
wonderful, think owe debt gratitude. just voicing stance here,
but-- LEX FRIDMAN: person. really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: wonderful person, brilliant person, good person, still
pay price making kind mistakes head company.
don't get extra bonus points good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
willingness go Rogan deal directly say, don't know answer
cases. deal directly really challenging questions earned
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. individual. still part him--
said-- OK, love Jack too, interact often. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. also part
system, talked about, argue Jack shouldn't brought anyone
else podcast. go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, right.
cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, guess head legal him. also
requires tremendous amount skill go podcast like Joe Rogan able
win trust people able transparent communicate
company really works reveal social media company
works, open security, vector attacks increases. Also,
lot difficult decisions terms censorship not made make
transparent going get order magnitude hate.
make kinds decisions, think one things realize
take avalanche potentially hate make mistakes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, clear picture architecture required
order create company. course, division labor too. mean, don't
things detail, finding people excellent do-- run
critical segments obviously key. just say said earlier,
heart's heart start company, that, indeed, calling, sounds like


is, can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: heart heart? don't know.
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN:
romanticize heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: lab one point, early days
worked cuttlefish, multiple hearts,

02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating

pump green blood, believe not. fascinating animal. Speaking hearts
green blood, earlier today sat solicited four questions
Instagram brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, take
real time. podcast team always teasing never charge
phone. one people likes run yellow, whatever is.
LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.

LEX FRIDMAN: iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: funny
always iPhone people battery. weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, just got new one. LEX FRIDMAN: weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mean,
one plenty battery. just got new one different numbers
different things, personal work, et cetera. trying now. right. Get the--
LEX FRIDMAN: chess thing mention you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,
yes, please. Will insult look questions ask me? LEX FRIDMAN:
No, no. will insult asking question think hilarious.
controversy cheating Hans Niemann, 2,700 player--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused cheating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: saw clip clips channel. way, love
clips channel, listen full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: big accusation
cheated having-- mean, half joke starting getting wonder
whether-- can cheat vibrating anal beads can send
messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, rephrase statement. Not can,
one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank
you. LEX FRIDMAN: personal attack, yes. made realize, mean--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: just going adjust seat here. LEX FRIDMAN:
use time podcasting send messages remind notes.
interesting. mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: not going call again.
LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly keep phone. get


whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value
journey took lesson. think work-life balance best learned hard way.
perspective. certain things can learn hard way,
learn hard way. Yeah, definitely advice. say
admire people work hard. want get good side, think
people give everything got towards something. doesn't actually matter
is, towards achieving excellence thing. highest thing
can reach human beings think excellence thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
love it. Well, speaking excellent thing. Whether not teaching MIT
podcast company resides near future create-- again,
speaking enormous number people excellence hard work, certainly,
woven everything do. Every time sit begin
finish immense feeling joy appreciation gratitude, wouldn't
Lex Fridman podcast, case Lex even guest podcast,
word love weren't mentioned least 10 times. feelings gratitude
work do, taking time today share us doing,
thoughts, insights, perplexed drives
callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can read poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not

trying cut off post. getting little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no,
no. thinking recently. one favorite Robert Frost poems, I--
wrote several essays it, do, think popular one
read. Essays being, like, trying interpret poetry, one sticks me.
mean, calm beauty, seriousness means ultimately
think the-- "Stopping Woods Snowy Evening." think ultimately
human being, man, asking old Sisyphus, old Camus question of, live?
think poem, even though doesn't seem like question man contending
suicide choosing live. Whose woods are, think know. house
village, though. will not see stopping watch woods fill
snow. little horse must think queer stop without farmhouse near
woods frozen lake, darkest evening year. gives harness bells
shake ask mistake. sound's sweep easy wind


downy flake. woods lovely, dark, deep, promises keep
miles go sleep, miles go sleep. woods representing
darkness, comfort woods representing death, man choosing live.
Yeah, think often, especially darker moments promises
keep. Thank me, Andrew. beautiful human being.

whole rabbit hole of, well, able send communication order
cheat different sports? mean, doesn't even chess particular,
interesting chess poker mechanisms modern day
streaming live competition people can watch TV. can send
signal back, they-- just fun little thing think possible pull off.
wanted get scientific evaluation that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: cheat
using sort interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating kind.
Yeah. no, no. one way send signals is, like, Morse code, basically.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. famous-- believe famous real
world story physics students-- going get wrong saying
kind coarse form somebody will correct this. believe physics
graduate students UC Santa Cruz somewhere else, maybe Caltech--
bunch universities no one associates one university went
Vegas used sort tactile device card counting thing. actually
demonstrated also-- not particular incident, don't think-- movie Casino
spotted a-- remember Robert De Niro, not vague resemblance
to, way, Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, wish De Niro impression
right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look up, folks. Travis Bickle Lex
ever shaved head Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: would. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
tapping device ankle signaling. Someone else counting
cards signaling person. yeah, done tactile way.
done, obviously, earpieces deep earpiece. think ways
look that. Certainly kind vibrational device whatever orifice provided
someone pay attention still playing game. Yeah, think entirely
possible. Now, done purely neurally? something was--
listen, wouldn't even skull. whenever people
hear Neuralink brain machine interface always think, oh, drill
skull put chip skull. think people walking
around nowadays glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- used
informative me, actually, kind experiment. Gave lot
interesting insights blood sugar regulation, reacts different foods, et
cetera. Well, can implant tactile device skin simple incision.
Actually, one neurosurgeons Neuralink know well came
point laboratory Stanford, actually put


radio receiver hand, wife too. can open locks house
things like that, doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: skin? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: skin. can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: work?
use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: piercer. go body piercer type
person can just slide there, got battery life something
fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: experience tactile--
haptics it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. just allows open certain locks
just hand, easily put sort tactile device there. LEX
FRIDMAN: connect nerves just like-- just vibration?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: can probably sense
even skin, wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can by-- can
Bluetooth linked. mean, seen-- Engineering Laboratory
University Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, got amazing device
size Band-Aid. goes clavicles uses sound waves pinged
body measure cavitation. Think moment. used
military where, say, leading operation something. People getting
shot, shot at, laptop can see bullet entry points are. people
dead? bleeding out? Entry, exit points. can get-- take battlefield
scenario. can get breathing, body position 24 hours day. much
can looking cavitation. sorts devices 12 hour Bluetooth
used send sorts signals. Maybe every time supposed hold
hand-- not good gambler play roulette go Vegas
just long, boring games, get good mileage run,
usually. maybe every time supposed hold, person gets stomach
cinching stimulating vagus little bit get little bit
ache. doesn't Morse code. can yes, no, maybe. Right? can
green, red, yellow type signaling. doesn't sophisticated give
somebody significant advantage. Anyway, haven't thought detail
conversation but, oh, yeah, immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: don't
know know poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, don't
follow gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, considered one
greatest poker players time legitimately. just incredibly good. got--
big case accused cheating prove-- not really
cheating, really fascinating. turns out-- plays poker. Texas


Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Well, relationship topic one talked little bit about,

02:24:44 Lex Wears Suit & Tie

last time touched little bit detail. going come back that,
made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,
actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. mean, everybody different journey
jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different
20s 30s later. like different-- not-- can
bit ego 20s. can fire you,
zenlike wise patient later life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one hope.
wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: think Rogan still meathead. still goes hard
crazy still super competitive that, people can-- Jocko


somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever

02:32:07 Advice Young People

something right still it, super
impressive. far many questions ask them, several, not
many, asked highly appropriate question arc discussion.
one, admittedly, ask podcast time, get great
pleasure question asker seat today. so, advice young
people? LEX FRIDMAN: just gave lecture MIT amount love got
incredible. course, talking usually undergrads, maybe
young graduate students, one person ask advice question
end. bunch Q&A. answer world will tell find
work-life balance, explore, try to-- try different fields see really connect
with, variety, general education, kind stuff. said 20s think
find one thing passionate work harder worked
anything else life. destroys you, destroys you. advice
20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
Exactly. think forgot-- people forgotten value

Hold'em, mostly, kinds poker. turns grid back cards
often printed little bit imperfectly, can use asymmetry
imperfections try figure certain cards. play remember
certain card is, like-- think 8 deck accused of-- 8 9
slightly different symmetry wise. can now ask dealer actually rotate
check symmetry. ask dealer rotate card see there's--
detect asymmetry back card, now knows cards 8's
9's likelier 8's 9's, using information play poker
win lot money. just slight advantage. case is-- fact,
judge found this, not actually cheating, not right. can't use kind
extra information. fascinating can discover little holes games
pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. fascinating.
think watch clip potential cheating event chess,
fact number chess players admit cheating point career. Very,
interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, online. online cheating easier, right?
playing online cheating game machine much better
human, difficult prove human. applies, way,
another really big thing social media, bots. running social media
company deal bots become-- one really exciting
things machine learning artificial intelligence, me, fast improvement
language models. neural networks generate text, interpret text,
generate text, images kind stuff. now going create
incredible bots look awfully lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, least
not going crypto bots seem populate comment section
post anything Instagram. actually delete even though add
comment roster if-- bother much. spend least 10, 15 minutes
post just deleting those. don't know need not interested
those, whatever offering. Speaking nonbots, going assume
questions not bots. lot questions here-- 10,000
questions.

02:22:25 Ideas Lately

Goodness. just take few, working top bottom. ideas


wrestling lately? think company one, scroll next,
others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, things talked about,
ideas understand true, true human being,
reveal that, reveal conversation, challenge
properly, leads understanding not derision. applies everybody
Donald Trump Vladimir Putin. Also another idea deep distrust science
trying understand-- growing distrust science, trying understand
role us foot scientific community, regain
trust. Also, there's-- talked about, find to-- yeah, find
maintain good relationship. mean, really been-- never felt quite
lonely year Ukraine. just like, many times just lay
just feeling deeply alone felt home-- not home literally
American. proud American. die American. home
sense generationally, family's home, now going-- changed forever.
no proud former Russia Ukraine. now
political message say-- show pride, extremely lonely.
within world, things pursuing, find successful
relationship? tough. obviously-- huge number technical
ideas startup of, like, hell make thing work? ANDREW

made note here. inspired Lex, you, wear suit every time
podcast? good question. don't know answer that. LEX FRIDMAN:
two answers question. One suit two black suit black tie
used do-- used variety, like always black
suit sometimes red tie blue tie. mostly trying fit
society varieties-- supposed variety. inspired
first general culture doesn't take seriously terms
present world. academia, tech world, Google, everybody
wearing pajamas relaxed. tech. don't know science,
chemistry, biology, on. computer science everybody very--


mean, relaxed terms stuff wear wanted try really take
seriously take every single moment seriously everything seriously,
suit made feel way. don't know looks, made feel way.
think, terms people look wore suit made think
probably Richard Feynman. see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: wonderful human
being. LEX FRIDMAN: see epitome class humor brilliance,
obviously never come close kind of-- able simply explain really
complicated ideas humor wit, definitely aspire that.
just Mad Men, whole era '50s, classiness that.
something suit removes importance fashion character.
see person. think not to-- forgot said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
somebody like this. wear shabby dress everyone sees dress.
wear beautiful dress everybody sees woman. sense was--
hopefully quoting correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX
FRIDMAN: think sense simple, classy suit allows people focus
character full responsibility that, am.
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that, love said just prior that.
father, who, again, always asking don't dress formally like always
said growing up, overdress

02:27:50 AI Equivalent Psychedelics?

slightly, least people know took seriously. sign respect
audience eyes. Someone asked, AI equivalent
psychedelics? assuming mean something machines can
order alter neural circuitry unconventional activation
patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, don't know exactly psychedelics
work, can see diffusion models now Dali stable
diffusion generates text, art. basically small injection noise
system deep representation visual information. able convert text
art introducing uncertainty noise that. kind maybe. see
parallel psychedelics, able create incredible things.
conceptual understanding thing, can create incredible art no human, think,
least easily created bit introduction randomness.



02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt Achieve

Randomness lot work machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot requests relationship, lot requests
statistics you, data specifically. Flipping past those,
hardest belt achieve jujitsu? assumed black belt,

jujitsu, people know. me, black belt ceremonial belt, not
usually case, fought wars. trained twice day don't know
many years-- seven, eight years. competed nonstop. competed people much
better me. competed many beaten many black belts brown belts.
think, personally, hardest belt brown belt because, people
know jujitsu, size tournament divisions blue belts purple belts just
humongous. Like Worlds, competed Worlds was, like, 140 people
division, means win-- forget many times, seven, eight, nine
times row medal. just put lot work time.
especially competitors, instructors usually really make earn belt. earn
purple belt extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. earn brown belt
means compete nonstop purple belts, young.
talking about-- people usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds
shredded, incredible cardio. can, reason, life can--
no kids, nothing. can dedicate everything pursuit training two,
three, four times day. Diet point. going-- me,
usually bigger taller just aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah,
go lot wars earn brown belt. then-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got try jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, should.
different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, tried it. one class, really want
embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: know, many pursuits like jujitsu different

20s. don't know universally true advice is, think least give
chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards thing really care about, work ass
off. said, met many people, starting think advice best
applied best tried engineer disciplines, especially programming. think
bunch disciplines can achieve success much fewer hours,
much important actually clarity thinking great ideas
energetic mind. grind certain disciplines not produce great work. just know
computer science programming often does. best people ever
built systems, programmed systems usually like John Carmack
kind people drink soda, eat pizza, program 18 hours day. don't know
actually. to, think, really go discipline specific. advice applies
life mostly spent behind computer, really,
really put hours. means essentially feels like grind.
recommend least try own. interview
accomplished people ever, think honest going talk
20s journey lot pain lot really hard work. think
really happens, unfortunately, lot successful people later life will talk


work-life balance. say, know learned process
really important get, like, sun morning, health, good
relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, chef.
